This is the news organization’s first major journalism award.CoinDesk’s Ian Allison and Tracy Wang won the prize for financial reporting, according to a statement Monday. Previous winners in that category include The Wall Street Journal’s series on Theranos and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ stories on the so-called Panama Papers.Created in 1949 by Long Island University to honor murdered war correspondent George Polk, the Polk Awards are among the most prestigious prizes in journalism and emphasize “investigative work that is original, resourceful and thought-provoking.” The trio of honored CoinDesk stories exemplified those qualities.“This is an important milestone, not only for CoinDesk, but for crypto media generally,” said Michael Casey, CoinDesk’s chief content officer. “Despite all that Ian and Tracy’s incredible reporting exposed – and the fallout that it triggered – the crypto industry will continue to have a significant impact on the world. It’s vital that it be covered with the kind of probing, well-informed, professional journalism embodied by these two reporters and their attentive, dedicated editors.”The industry-shaking Nov. 2 story from Allison, a senior reporter, resulted from a source’s tip that Sam Bankman-Fried’s closely held trading firm, Alameda Research, was on shakier financial footing than was generally known. Allison got to work finding evidence and nailed it by obtaining the company’s balance sheet, which was not a public document.It showed that a significant portion of Alameda’s billions of dollars in assets was secretly made up of FTT, a sort of digital Monopoly money issued by Bankman-Fried’s better-known FTX crypto exchange.The resulting story raised concerns about the stability of Alameda and FTX, and called into question Bankman-Fried’s image as a white knight capable of backstopping struggling companies and as an “adult in the room” in a field notorious for fly-by-night outfits and scammers. The article debuted in a world where FTX was fast becoming a household name thanks to a marketing blitz featuring Larry David, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.Within days the price of FTT plummeted and Bankman-Fried agreed to a bailout from rival exchange Binance. Almost immediately, Binance got cold feet, as revealed by another Polk-winning scoop from Allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market. Hours later, Binance confirmed it was backing out of the deal.Wang, a deputy managing editor, provided the third CoinDesk scoop honored by the Polk Awards: A story revealing that Bankman-Fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury Bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that Bankman-Fried and Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison had once been a couple. The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on FTX’s extremely lax administrative procedures.Nine days after Allison’s initial story, Bankman-Fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection. Not long after, Bankman-Fried was arrested and the U.S. Congress held hearings.There is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly. The fallout reverberated throughout the crypto industry and even hurt CoinDesk’s corporate sibling Genesis and parent company Digital Currency Group, underscoring CoinDesk’s editorial independence and dedication to telling important stories.More than 2,000 news stories have credited CoinDesk for setting off the chain of events, including pieces from high-profile publications like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Verge, New York Magazine, CNN and NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast.“As great an honor as the George Polk award is, I gotta say Ian and Tracy totally deserve it for some of the best journalism it’s been my pleasure to witness,” said Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief. “They and the work they did are totally awesome. I also need to give a shout-out to Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, who was a key partner to Ian and Tracy in bringing these market-shaking stories to life, and to the rest of the CoinDesk news team, which kicked butt on covering the maelstrom that resulted from Ian and Tracy’s incredible scoops.”Read More: CoinDesk’s Major Award Is a Huge Moment for Us and Crypto Media Generally"},

More than half is earmarked for the offline payments service.While around 100 economies worldwide are considering issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a way to sashay into the digital age and compete with private cryptocurrencies, among major jurisdictions, the 27-nation European Union is showing particular interest in preparing for one.For the past few years, the ECB has been exploring issuing a digital version of the euro, the currency used by around 340 million people in 20 EU countries. In 2023, the bloc’s executive arm even proposed legislation for the digital currency, outlawing interest and large holdings, while promising offline payments from day 1.Although officials at the ECB have repeatedly said the work on a digital euro is not a commitment to issue one, the calls for providers indicate promises made in the legislative proposals could be putting pressure on it to deliver.Last week, alongside the application calls, the bank published an update on the development of a rulebook for the CBDC.The $1.3 billion may seem like a lot of money, but what the ECB’s asking for is no mean feat, Jonas Gross, chairman of industry group the Digital Euro Association (DEA), said in an interview. For the ECB’s expectations, the budget seems reasonable, he said.“My first reaction was, oh, man, this is really a lot of money,” said Gross. “But when you think about it's a contract that goes for a few years, where the ECB really expect the partners to deliver a product that’s … really kind of perfect to be implemented on the market.”Offline paymentsMore than half the budget, as much as 56%, is promised to potential providers of the offline component of the CBDC, Gross pointed out.“This, I think, shows that this is serious, they want this, … you could also interpret it in that there are still some open questions, and there is just a lot of expertise from vendors required to get this on the street,” Gross said.Enabling offline payments is widely viewed as one of the most important hurdles to overcome when it comes to implementing CBDCs. The ECB is planning two digital euros for retail payments, with one of them exclusively for offline use with holdings too held offline. Gross said he envisions one app that enables both versions, and says building such a product in a user-friendly way may be a challenge.Choosing providersWho the ECB ends up choosing to build out these services is also an open question. In 2022, the ECB was lambasted by EU lawmakers for choosing U.S. tech giant Amazon to create an e-commerce prototype for the digital euro.Gross said the ECB might shy away from “exotic” choices and stick to traditional finance players with some presence in Europe this time.These developments follow the ECB moving its digital euro project to a “preparation phase” in October to flesh out a rulebook and select providers to help build the platform. A decision on issuing a euro comes after legislation is finalized in the European Parliament, but with proposals facing political pushback, approval is not guaranteed.Edited by Sheldon Reback."},

NYSE also has a number of liquidity programs, he said.\"For market makers that are out there – and we've got dozens of market makers that provide liquidity for our ETFs that are going to step in – they've had natural hedges available to them,\" he said. \"We have a very nice price-discovery process that will happen at the New York Stock Exchange overnight all the way into the open, so we expect a pretty dynamic and liquid market tomorrow.\"Robert Mitchnick, the head of digital assets at BlackRock, told CoinDesk in an interview that the asset manager would use its partnership with Coinbase. The company integrated Coinbase Prime with its own portfolio management tool, Aladdin, in 2021. While he wouldn't speak to how much BlackRock had lined up in terms of assets under management at launch for its bitcoin ETF, he noted that the company had already disclosed a $10 million seed investment.\"As is public, there was a seed investment in the ETF that was made by BlackRock,\" he said. \"One of the things that's really important to understand is we view this as a long process.\"No immediate rushDavid Mann, Franklin Templeton's head of ETF products and capital markets, told CoinDesk in an interview that it was difficult to predict just what inflows might look like in the first few days. While he expects \"a ton of excitement\" on day one, he said there may be a more gradual ramp up in interest and investments than people appreciate.\"It wouldn't shock me if ETF users broadly who are now looking at getting some exposure to bitcoin within the ETF vehicle are going to go through their normal review process to make sure that they're comfortable with the ETF, and that often takes time,\" he said.There may be a \"pop out of the gate,\" but investors may take weeks or months to become comfortable with the bitcoin ETF vehicle and verify that it is behaving in a way they would be willing to put money into, he said.BlackRock's Mitchnick echoed this point, saying it would be a \"long journey\" after the launch for investors. He pointed to wealth advisers as an example, saying they may be part of the largest investment channel for the ETF. Because they have not yet had much exposure to investment vehicles containing bitcoin, there would be \"a journey of education\" before they may allocate funds.\"There'll be suitability conversations between advisers and clients,\" he said. \"It's not something that is going to materialize right away out of the gate, and the same thing for institutional investors who hitherto have not really had viable exposure solutions.\"Read more: Gary Gensler's Begrudging Bitcoin ETF Concession: 'We Did Not Approve or Endorse Bitcoin'CORRECTION (Jan. 11, 2024, 16:44 UTC): An earlier version of the story stated that BlackRock had $100,000 in seed capital, as opposed to $10 million.Edited by Nick Baker and Marc Hochstein."},
{"url": "https://www.coindesk.com:443/learn/what-is-web5-and-how-is-it-different-from-web3/", "article title": "", "article subtitle": "There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.", "article body": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"?It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 = 5.Web5 presentation (tbd.website)Web5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.Dorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”There are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.So, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.TBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).One of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”This article was originally published on Dec 20, 2022 at 8:40 p.m. UTC"},

Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.According to the white paper, Zhao's goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.Shortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.What’s the difference between Binance and Binance.US?Binance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance's proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.Binance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.One of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.The other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.Finally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.Binance: A timeline of major events and notable newsJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.July 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.January 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.April 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)April 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.May 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ's \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space.June 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services.July 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace.September 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.September 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch.April 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M&A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.”September 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform.November 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts.April 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role.August 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job.September 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm.April 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation.September 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD.October 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto.October 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter.November 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light.December 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital's assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.February 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.March 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.April 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.April 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\"June 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance's staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.Edited by Rosie Perper.This article was originally published on Jun 6, 2023 at 6:13 p.m. UTC"},

Tokenization refers to placing traditional financial assets such as credit, real estate or bonds – so-called real-world assets – on a blockchain.The market of tokenized assets could mushroom to $5 trillion in the next five years, bringing operational efficiencies and improving liquidity and accessibility for investors and asset managers, Bernstein said in a report earlier this year.Read more: The Trillion Dollar Crypto Opportunity: Real World Asset TokenizationTokenization of private credit marketsUntangled aims to bring the traditional private credit market – currently more than $1 trillion in size – to blockchains via tokenization. The current size of private credit on decentralized finance (DeFi) rails only totals $550 million of assets, according to rwa.xyz data.Manrui Tang and Quan Le, co-founders of Untangled, said in an interview with CoinDesk that the platform focuses on fintech lending – for example invoice financing and consumer loans based on salary advances – and so-called “green assets,” such as working capital or development loans for green infrastructure projects like battery swapping stations,Untangled provides infrastructure to host blockchain-based credit pools, where investors – in this case, certified investors, firms, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – deposit funds to lend and earn a yield. Depositors receive an ERC-20 token that represents their positions.The platform brings a few novelties among RWA lending protocols, the co-founders explained. It has a built-in liquidation engine that may auction off certain collateral assets to improve the pool’s overall health if it falls below a certain threshold. The company has crafted a forward-looking credit assessment model that monitors the borrower’s future default risks. The protocol also offers an auction-based withdrawal mechanism for investors who want to exit the pools early.“We see an upcoming merging of worlds,” Francesco Filia, CEO and CIO of Fasanara Capital, said in a statement. “On one side, fintech lending which fills the gap in underserved SME and consumer markets and, on the other, the way values are being transferred within the new world of digital assets.”Edited by Stephen Alpher."},

The war's death toll has neared 1,600 on both sides, according to the Associated Press.“The global market worries that the conflict will spread to nearby oil-producing countries so investors are still relatively sensitive,” said Greta Yuan, head of research at digital assets platform VDX, in an email to CoinDesk. “As the geopolitics of the Middle East worsened over the weekend and market risk-averse sentiment increased, as a result, spot gold rose by nearly 1%.”Crypto markets had earlier slumped 2% on Monday as traders priced in rising oil prices and a drop in traditional equities as the turmoil could impact international trade.Futures traders betting on higher prices saw over $100 million in liquidations over a 24-hour period from Monday, as alternative currencies saw a sell-off. However, crypto markets are showing signs of early resilience that may instill confidence among bulls.“Currently, we've observed a temporary dip in Bitcoin's price following the shocking news of the conflict, but the price has already stabilized,” noted Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE. “Crypto assets have shown resilience in the face of rising geopolitical turmoil in the past.”“For instance, when the U.S. imposed sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we saw a sharp rebound in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market - that was in March last year,” Mei added.In early 2022, military tensions between Russia and Ukraine saw bitcoin shed as much as 7% in a single day, displaying the significance and impact of geopolitical struggles on the niche asset class. At such times, typically, investors tend to flee to gold, while assets deemed riskier tend to see declines.Meanwhile, some traders say investors should keep an eye out for oil and energy market changes for now to gain a sense of where bitcoin may be headed.“Regarding macroeconomic implications, should the risks of expansion and conflict escalation materialize, we must keep an eye on energy prices again,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a message to CoinDesk. “Rising oil prices are triggering a wave of sell-off in equities, fuelling expectations of tighter monetary policy. And that's the most considerable risk to assets like Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole.”“However, if we see a quick return to some form of normalcy, that would be a positive for cryptocurrencies. But for now, that looks like a less likely scenario,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that, for now, the chances of appetite for equities and cryptocurrencies to shrink was higher compared to the past weeks.Edited by Parikshit Mishra and Kevin Reynolds."},

{"url": "https://www.coindesk.com:443/learn/what-are-fully-backed-reserves/", "article title": "", "article subtitle": "More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.", "article body": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.This system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.Read More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?After so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?Fully backed, explainedWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.So, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.A stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.Fully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.This is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.But “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.Until October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its ValueSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.On the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.This article was originally published on Nov 22, 2022 at 11:04 p.m. UTC"},

At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.In December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.Read More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader ExperienceBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.DESK FAQ:What is DESK?DESK is CoinDesk’s social token.What is DESK’s mission?DESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.DESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.How can I get DESK?As of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:Listening to episodes of Carpe ConsensusWatching select CDTV episodesVisiting the DESK HubEngaging in chats on our Discord serverAt Consensus 2023, we'll have many in-person ways to earn DESK, such as 2022's Easter egg airdrops around the festival. Stay tuned!Cool, so what can I do with DESK?Unlock the token-gated Discord serverUsers with at least 1 DESK can vote for our special community polls and earn DESK for engaging.You can tip other users with DESKAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:A drink at the barFood from nearby vendors that have partnered with CoinDeskMerchandise, such as hoodies or T-shirtsNon-fungible tokens (NFT) from our online marketplaceSpecial on-site offers from Consensus exhibitors and partnersUnique experiences, like playing \"Horse\" basketball with Spencer Dinwiddie or chess with Garry Kasparov.On what blockchain is DESK?DESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.Why isn’t DESK on Ethereum proper?Polygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.What do I need to do before the next Consensus to be able to spend DESK?You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.Read more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your WalletDo I need to create a CoinDesk account to use DESK?Yes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.What is the problem you’re trying to solve?In the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.We believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.Why do you need a blockchain for loyalty points?Social tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.Initially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.Simply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.Will DESK increase in value?No. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.Why doesn’t DESK have monetary value?It is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.By providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We've seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.Can I mine DESK?No. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.Can I stake my DESK to earn more tokens?No. See above.Is CoinDesk using DESK to raise funds?No. We're not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.If the token is on mainnet, what’s to stop anyone from listing it on an exchange or trading it?Listing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.Banning? Blacklisting? That doesn’t sound very decentralized. What gives?It’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.So, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.OK, but if DESK has no monetary value how did taco stands or bars in Austin accept it during Consensus 2022?Part of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.Are there gas (on-chain computation) fees for using DESK?No. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.How?CoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.What if I got DESK in 2021 at the virtual Consensus? Can I still use it?Because DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK's beta testers.Who are the 'Piranhas'?Piranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.At Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.Who built DESK?CoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.Which wallets support DESK?As mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.How do I connect my DESK wallet to my CoinDesk account?Navigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet.Are DESK transactions anonymous?Depends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK's page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.Do I need to report DESK transactions on my taxes?DESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.How do I keep up with DESK updates?We’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.You can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.What’s the future of DESK?The latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We'll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experienceThis article was originally published on Dec 9, 2022 at 2:08 p.m. UTC"},

", "article body": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.October 2017 – BlockFi beginsZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.February 2018 to December 2018 – BlockFi’s first funding roundsVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.March 2019 – BlockFi offers compound interest accountFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.August 2019 - Series A fundingThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.December 2019 – BlockFi expands into tradingIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.February 2020 - Series B funding roundPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.March 2020 - Cash on-ramps arriveBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits  via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren't already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.May 2020 - BlockFi suffers minor hackAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.August 2020 – BlockFi gets more fundingIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.October 2020 – BlockFi makes a risky betIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.BlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.January 2021 - BlockFi’s bitcoin ambitionsEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.March 2021 – BlockFi gets new funding, $3B valuationAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?July 2021 – Bad timing amid an onslaught of cease and desist ordersNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.The CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.February 2022 – BlockFi settles with the SECIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.Summer 2022 – BlockFi spirals downwardIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund's collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.In dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.November 2022 – FTX collapse slams BlockFi, firm files for bankruptcyAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.That was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.BlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried's Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.In the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX.

", "article body": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.Here’s why:Very broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.Early analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.Ahead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.Critics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”Read More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?To critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.In any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple's side of the case, XRP's price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.See Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”Edited by Toby Leah Bochan.This article was originally published on Jun 14, 2023 at 4:49 p.m. UTC"},

While crypto traders, tradfi investors, financial institutions and probably lots of normies and newbies were engaging in the gripping speculation over whether U.S. regulators would approve a spot bitcoin ETF, a struggle over the very soul of the Bitcoin blockchain was taking place on the open-source developer platform GitHub. At the core of the matter was whether data-oriented applications like Ordinals inscriptions – often referred to as \"NFTs on Bitcoin\" – should be allowed on a network that purists argue should be preserved primarily as a settlement layer for peer-to-peer payments. In September, the longtime Bitcoin developer Luke Dashjr, who sits in the latter camp, created a proposal – technically known as a \"pull request\" or PR – to put strict limits on the amount of data that could be stuffed into an individual transaction. The proposal quickly touched off an acrimonious debate that went on for months, until several days ago when Ava Chow, a maintainer of the paramount Bitcoin Core software, abruptly closed the PR without taking action. \"It's abundantly clear that this PR is controversial and, in its current state, has no hope of reaching a conclusion that is acceptable to everyone,\" Chow wrote, the last post in the thread. It's possible there could be additional chapters, though, since Dashjr later tweeted, \"Spam filtering isn't dead until the spam is dead.\"ICYMI: We finally got around to reading this report from last month by Galaxy Research's Christine Kim (who by the way is also the former co-author of The Protocol's predecessor newsletter, Valid Points) on why ETH might underperform in the near term.

In an overview of the relative ability for eight stablecoins to be redeemed for one dollar, the currency to which they are all pegged, S&P has also — arguably and indirectly — affirmed that stablecoins are likely not going anywhere.Unmute“We always say our role is assessing if there are ways that we think that we can reduce the asymmetry of information in the market — that is really the way I see our role in the market,” Lapo Guadagnuolo, a senior analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He added that crypto “is something we're putting strong resources towards, because we know it's a growing area both in traditional and new financial areas.”That said, of the eight stablecoins S&P reviewed, several received lackluster scores. Most notably Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap and most used crypto asset in terms of trading volume, was given the fourth-lowest score in range from 1 to 5. Meanwhile MakerDAO’s dai (DAI), popular across decentralized finance (DeFi), and the Justin Sun-backed TrueUSD, the fourth and fifth largest stablecoins, respectively, were also given low scores.At the end of 2023, crypto is not yet past the age where receiving any attention — positive or negative — from an institution like S&P is seen as a form of affirmation. A similar phenomenon happened two years ago, when the U.S. Treasury Department under Janet Yellen convened a study group to determine the risks that Tether’s stablecoin posed to the U.S. economy, which can be validating for industry actors with anti-establishment roots.Similarly, S&P’s report is a signal that these tools are important — whether or not they actually represent technical advancements.“The ratings are a very positive development in the normalization of stablecoins,” Nic Carter, a co-founder of VC firm Castle Island Ventures, who began his career as Fidelity’s first dedicated bitcoin (BTC) analyst. “I have quibbles with some of the methodology used, but the fact that the major ratings agencies are paying attention to stablecoins and developing bespoke methodologies is quite validating for the sector,” he said in a private message.See also: Paolo Ardoino: The Hardest Working Man in Crypto | Most Influential 2023Indeed, S&P’s mixed report might just be the analysis that the stablecoin sector needed, an independent review of one of the crypto industry’s only tools that could be said to have product-market fit. Stablecoins are big and growing bigger because they offer a way for people across the world to access the dominant U.S. dollar-denominated financial system, and are useful in the U.S. because they’re essentially wire transfers without the hangups.While the review will likely be cited by many firms on Wall Street looking to test the waters of stablecoins (and many are), not everyone in crypto is taken with S&P’s work. Perhaps for good reason.“I haven't been impressed with the efforts of S&P or Moody's in this space,” Austen Campbell, a Columbia Business School professor and former Paxos fund manager, said in a direct message. “They seem really out of their depth and not able to iterate on new products. Quite frankly, outside of regular debt, they haven't added a ton of value in new things.”It was a point echoed by Carter: “Ultimately I don't think crypto native clients of stablecoins will care much for the ratings — end of the day, traders like tether because it's convenient, lindy and is perceived to be remote from U.S. regulators.”He added: “But the ratings are positive in terms of institutional entities getting comfortable with the sector.”No stablecoin S&P assessed received the highest possible rating, though Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), Gemini’s gemini dollar and Paxos’s flagship pax dollar were rated as 2s on the list, for “strong.” Earlier this year, the Binance branded BUSD token issued by Paxos, which was the third-largest stablecoin at time, was targeted by U.S. authorities — it was not rated by S&P.Guadagnuolo explained that S&P’s ratings were not endorsements of any particular products, or even condemnations. Even “weak” assessments of stablecoins like TrueUSD (TUSD) or Frax (FRAX), which received the lowest possible score, should not be treated as “financial advice,” Guadagnuolo said. Both TUSD and FRAX are “algorithmic stablecoins,” which use cryptographic mechanisms rather than assets held in a treasury to support their peg to the greenback.“That's what sometimes people forget to focus on; the ratings are a relative ranking,” Guadagnuolo said. “We don't endorse and we don't condemn things when we give our opinion.” He clarified the rankings are “forward looking,” an attempt to determine “the likelihood” of the stablecoin maintaining its peg. (This is an important quality for a financial tool that promises to return every dollar deposited, and unlike banks gets to keep the accrued interest earned on those dollars rather than paying yield to users. It’s a lucrative business: Tether made profits of more than $1billion in Q3.)Notably, S&P did not use its traditional rating system commonly applied to government and corporate debt or assets like credit default swaps (CDOs), where products can be rated from AAA to D. Guadagnuolo said this isn’t unusual, and that the specific terms used “are not new for us.”“We believe that there is enough differentiation by using five scores,” he said. “Using more scores, we've felt at least at this stage would be probably alluding to a level of precision or specificity which is not there as of now.”Guadagnuolo, who was project lead on the “Stablecoin Stability Assessment,” also said that the ratings were made using only publicly-available data. He was not, for instance, in dialogue with Tether or Circle, and did not receive a snapshot of the stablecoin issuers’ assets held in a bank, in the way that an auditor might have privileged access to this information. He said he was one of the earliest employees at S&P to focus on the emerging world of crypto. The New York-based company hosts a number of crash courses on market sub-sectors including DeFi.For competitive reasons an S&P’s spokesperson could not disclose how many people contributed to the assessment, or how many employees focus on crypto full or part time at S&P.See also: The Niche Application of Stablecoins Is Not a Bad Thing | OpinionStablecoins, in a sense, are a type of privately issued currency. For instance, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, the top federal banking regulator, recently compared stablecoins to the “Wildcat” era of banking, when individual savings institutions printed their own unique dollars. There are theoretical risks to this form of currency expansion (the late-19th century saw a number of boom and bust credit cycles), as well as certain benefits like the transparency and settlement guarantees of blockchains.When asked if it is easier to look at on-chain assets than traditional credit ratings, Guadagnuolo said “yes,” with caveats. “There is surely much more information more easily available” for stablecoins than other “exotic” products, which might have “minimal documentation,” he said. “If you know where to go and look,” he added, there is a level of “transparency” in knowing “exactly how the workings of the smart contract work” or “what the volumes are — you can see that in a second.”However blockchains often obscure as much as they reveal. Investors and users frequently do not know who built a protocol, if it was properly audited or other information that they might have access to “in a regulated space,” Guadagnuolo said. Ironically, crypto, which was created to reduce trust and the need for intermediaries in online transactions often requires users to act more on blind faith and place their trust in strangers than when using a credit card or opening a bank account.There were many other questions Guadagnuolo could not answer or that an S&P communications rep interjected to say he could not answer, including whether he would use any particular stablecoin, if he was personally interested in any DeFi mechanisms or whether he felt the weight of responsibility publishing information that — intended or not — will likely be taken as financial advice. Guadagnuolo was also not able to directly address why it is S&P, of all institutions, has legitimacy to comment on the credibility of stablecoins (see the Great Financial Crisis that birthed Bitcoin).“We have a strong, strong history. I don't think we need to … It's kind of for you guys,” Guadagnuolo said.Whether or not intended, S&P has validated crypto to the extent that the stablecoin industry is now big, lucrative and fascinating enough that companies like S&P cannot look away. And however much it wants to say that its assessments are “opinions,” they are undoubtedly read as informed statements of fact that will go on to influence trading and investment decisions.That may not exactly be the case at the level of a “DeFi degen,” who at this point is likely inured to criticisms of Tether or who has reasons of convenience to choose USDT or FRAX or TUSD, but S&P’s comments are influential when it comes to publicly-traded companies or esteemed institutions that must be accountable for its decisions and actions. Say Tether collapses, Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street broker that recently gave the offshore company a massive public vote of confidence, will take much more than just a financial hit.See also: Tether Freezes 41 Crypto Wallets Tied to SanctionsLikewise, crypto as a whole is dependent on its relationships with traditional power brokers and crown makers — even as it nominally sets out to dethrone the king. (How much of bitcoin’s price action this year resulted from BlackRock’s unexpected spot bitcoin ETF application? There’s no definitive answer, but it’s not zero.) It’d be a mistake to read too much into S&P’s report; afterall, blockchains are open systems and S&P did not need anyone’s approval to do its research into stablecoin trustworthiness.The one thing Guadagnuolo might say S&P truly confirmed is that there is a mix of stablecoins, each with their relative risks and benefits. And so long that holds true, they’ll always have a mix of users — including people today who need to be convinced of their importance."},

It later posted “$BTC,” before both tweets were promptly deleted.Those tweets caused bitcoin prices to immediately spike to $47,680 from the $46,800 level. It then fell as low as $45,400 as the tweets were found to be fake.Punters and automated bots, however, reacted quickly to the tweets. Over $500 million in futures positions were opened in a ten-minute period following the initial post, data shows. But the highly-levered positions took a hit as prices whipsawed: Some $50 million in longs were liquidated while $36 million in shorts were impacted.Open interest spiked after the fake SEC post. (Coinglass)Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.A decision on thirteen proposed bitcoin ETFs is expected on Wednesday, with Bloomberg analysts placing approval odds at over 90% and crypto market bettors a relatively smaller 85%.Meanwhile, some crypto market participants criticized the SEC’s seemingly lax security measures to protect its account – even asking how the financial regulator could safeguard trillion-dollar markets if it couldn’t protect its social accounts.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."},

Network uptime was 100% for the 14th straight year. 2023 also saw much more widespread recognition that Bitcoin’s relationship to energy and the environment is overwhelmingly positive, contributing to electrical grid stabilization and creating economic incentives to mitigate carbon emissions.Looking forward to 2024, one thing that’s certain to happen is the next “halving,” when the new issuance of Bitcoin will be cut in half at block 840,000, which is expected to be mined in late April. Despite growing demand for Bitcoin, the supply added per block will nevertheless be reduced by 50%. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin’s history. Historically, a bull market has followed halvings. Whether causation or anomaly, it's true until it's not, and we plan Swan's strategy incorporating a high probability of a bull market in 2024 and 2025.In addition, it is almost certain that we will see the approval of one or more spot Bitcoin ETFs. This would open up floodgates of capital currently in traditional investment channels. The consensus is that this is most likely to happen in January.Bitcoin's technology trends in 2023 included the continued impact of the Taproot upgrade, enhancing transaction efficiency and privacy. The Lightning Network's maturation underscored Bitcoin's ability to scale by adding layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol to facilitate faster, more economical transactions. Lightning infrastructure has come a long way, with scores of lightning-enabled wallets, on-demand Lightning nodes, and facilitating an estimated 200,000 transactions per day. It will be interesting to watch what this more mature Lightning Network will do in the sustained high-fee environment of another bull market.In 2024, amid global financial uncertainty, Bitcoin's stability could attract attention from individuals, institutions, and governments seeking to reduce chaos. Bitcoin is reaching record values against weak currencies, gaining support from global politicians, and being used more by people and businesses worldwide. Bitcoin's growth is natural, without central control, and driven by millions of people worldwide who recognize its benefits. Bitcoin safeguards global monetary integrity, and sound money is a fundamental human right.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

", "article body": "We have arrived at the start of the next bull market. If history is our guide, these cycles are powered by multiple factors including Bitcoin's halving events, shifts in macroeconomic landscapes around U.S. elections and Federal Reserve interest rates, as well as the advent of new Web3 and DeFi innovations. Yield farming, for instance, was a significant innovation that fueled the previous cycle. The upcoming cycle may potentially feature a mix of zero-knowledge proofs, novel DeFi primitives like restaking, and innovative blockchain stacks that offer modularity, composability, and are primed for interchain asset and data movement.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package.Each cycle is accompanied by a unique cultural narrative. The last cycle was dominated by art NFTs, sparked by Beeple's $69 million sale at Christie’s, and further fueled by the PFP craze and the fine arts use case growing with proponents at the scale of Sotheby’s and Pace Gallery. The present cycle, predictions suggest, will be molded by the SocialFi narrative, as platforms like Friend.Tech have already set the stage.Institutional and regulatory narratives, too, play a crucial role. The last cycle saw MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor introducing Bitcoin to the corporate balance sheet, while this cycle is marked by traditional financial institutions and fintech giants applying for crypto ETFs and launching stablecoins.On the regulatory front, the U.S. is still wrestling with crypto regulations, causing many projects to market their new crypto products outside the U.S. This is why I argue that the next bull market will have a distinct geographical flavor, with Asia taking center stage.UnmuteThe enthusiasm for crypto in Asia is hard to miss. A stark contrast was visible between less vibrant fall conferences in the States and the buzzing scenes at Korea Blockchain Week and Token2049 in Singapore. Cities like Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila, and Kuala Lumpur, not to mention a handful of large Indian cities, are home to substantial developer communities and flourishing Web3 scenes, bolstered by government support and enterprise adoption. The thriving environment at Token2049, in Singapore, the real capital being deployed by APAC investors into crypto projects, and the increasing appetite for NFTs collectively suggest a region primed to drive the next bull market.While Asian governments vie for the top spot as a crypto hub, the U.S. seems to discourage its crypto entrepreneurs. As a result, marketing campaigns are excluding the U.S., businesses are expanding in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East to cater to growing demand, and entrepreneurs are relocating to jurisdictions with a friendlier regulatory environment.Opening Serotonin offices in APAC, I've witnessed firsthand the unique advantages these markets offer to growing crypto projects. From tech-savvy, mobile-first audiences to high-quality developers eager to contribute to decentralized projects, the region is brimming with potential. There's a palpable enthusiasm for Web3 culture and a readiness to adopt new technologies, particularly SocialFi, which is already the norm in the region, thanks to exposure to WeChat. (SocialFi refers to applications allowing users to monetize social interactions and control their own data.)Telegram, ubiquitously used for messaging by the Web3 community in Asia, is already testing out its self-custody crypto wallet in-app with non-U.S. users. Combining this with the regulatory friendliness of places like Hong Kong and Singapore, we are looking at a potentially explosive crypto boom. To us Americans, it feels borderline unimaginable that First Digital in Hong Kong, for example, could launch its stablecoin, FDUSD, with regulatory approval, when fintech mainstays like PayPal face subpoenas for doing the same in the US.This \"Asia speed,\" as we at Serotonin affectionately term it, is a testament to the region's rapid adoption and contribution to Web3 technologies. I believe this dynamic will steer the upcoming bull market and introduce a geographical narrative to the crypto cycle.However, I foresee this scenario changing in about 18 months, post the next U.S. election. I expect regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S. to emerge, sparking a new cycle of enterprise adoption and marketing to U.S. consumers. This period will also see the re-emergence of the U.S. as a primary driver of Web3 innovation and adoption, contributing to a thriving global Web3 ecosystem, with leadership from Asia and other markets.In the meantime, our strategy is to use this time to grow our business with a focus on Asia. We're facilitating Western projects' entry into Asian markets, forming partnerships with Eastern-originated projects to go global, and connecting with English-speakers in Europe and the Middle East. All things considered, the crypto world is set for a more diverse and dynamic era driven by various global forces, with Asia leading the charge in the imminent bull cycle.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

It’s nothing short of a revolution. Based on what we've seen, and reported, they're not wrong. Or, at least, it seems safe to say, the pace of innovation and speed of new developments in the blockchain space rarely ceases to stun; except for those moments when it all seems to look alike.This year's crypto-market doldrums brought little respite from the announcements, product rollouts, integrations, partnerships, collaborations, fundraisings, launches, deployments, migrations, transitions.

Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast. And our can't-miss column of blockchain tech updates, Protocol Village.Interoperability\"By 2024 and beyond, the advancement of blockchain interoperability protocols will mark a major shift by breaking down the existing silos between different blockchains. This shift will enable diverse blockchain platforms to seamlessly interact by sharing data and value transfer, creating a unified and more efficient blockchain ecosystem. The role of interoperability protocols will be crucial in this transformation, as they will increase innovation, as well as foster new applications and use cases, specifically in DeFi.\" - David Schwartz, CTO, Ripple Labs.Bitcoin fees\"In light of decreasing fixed block rewards for miners, our view is that catalysts for raising the variable block rewards from transaction fees will be increasingly important. The core Bitcoin protocol is in a largely stable state, with the Taproot upgrade in November 2021 being the only major protocol upgrade in the past five years – at least with regards to changes that have required a soft fork. Thus, we believe usage catalysts will originate from technological innovation, mostly within the confines of the existing network protocol such as increased usage of blob data like Ordinals and Atomicals, elevated activity on secondary layer 2s like the Lightning Network (LN), or general smart-contract environments built on top of the Bitcoin network like Rootstock, Stacks, RGB or future implementations of BitVM.\" - David Duong, head of institutional research, Coinbase.Modularity“We’ve also seen a consolidation on the modular thesis and exciting developments in this space as more and more hybrid solutions come to market such as Ethereum roll ups using Celestia as the data availability layer. Meanwhile we also have blockchains like Solana continuing in its monolithic direction and saying no to layer 2s because they view them as bad for liquidity and the user experience. It will be interesting to watch these two narratives play out in 2024, especially as some Ethereum rollups explore using the Solana virtual machine.” - Abdelhamid Bakhta, lead and core Ethereum developer, Starknet ecosystem.UnmuteZero-Knowledge Proofs\"SNARKs allow the computation of a 'cryptographic receipt' of some compute workload by an untrusted “prover” impossible to forge: In the past computing such a receipt cost 10^9 work overhead over the original compute; recent advances are bringing this number closer to 10^6. SNARKs therefore become viable in situations where the initial compute provider can bear a 10^6 overhead and the clients cannot re-execute or store initial data. The use cases that result are many: Edge devices in the Internet of Things can verify upgrades. Media editing software can embed content authenticity and transformation data; while remixed memes could pay homage to initial sources. LLM inferences could include authenticity information. We could have self-verifying IRS forms, unforgeable bank audits, and many more uses that benefit consumers ahead.\" - Sam Ragsdale, investment engineer, a16z.Key management/user interfaces“The emergence of account abstraction means that we can soon overcome the technical challenges of self-custody. 2024 will be the year that seed phrases can finally become a historical practice for most. The idea that the safety of assets meant having 12 words that you can never lose, but no one else can ever access, is outdated and to a large extent has been holding back progress for actual user adoption. As such, blockchain is in a position to deliver on the promise of inclusive finance that’s been so central to our values since the beginning.” - Friederike Ernst, co-founder, Gnosis and Gnosis Pay.Censorship\"Centralization concerns essentially boil down to two core issues: (1) Does a certain vector of centralization lead to network performance issues that put applications at risk of outages? And (2) will centralization create censorship challenges? One of the interesting things about the disentanglement of block building, relaying and validation in Ethereum is that it cleanly separates censorship challenges between three different layers of the Ethereum transaction processing stack. After the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash addresses last summer, major Ethereum relays began to censor transactions. The problem only abated once Flashbots open-sourced its market-dominant relay, and allowed permissionless relays like Ultra Sound, Agnostic and bloXroute to become more competitive. Today, it's block builders who have increasingly begun to censor transactions. I'd expect some of the biggest development breakthroughs in 2024 to come in areas like mempool encryption that shield transactions from potentially censorious parties before they are included in a block.\" - Ryan Selkis, founder and CEO, Messari.Security/privacy\"In 2023 there have been tons of hacks and fraud within the crypto space including Euler Finance and Angle Protocol. We will see blockchain protocols creating more security solutions and taking privacy more seriously.\" - Ramani Ramachandran, CEO, Router Protocol.Corporate crypto\"Networks and developer platforms should be prepared for onboarding corporate and startup builders, as well as independent developers. Network protocol teams should be prepared with user experiences that can reach millions of end users in their native digital experiences. Larger companies are moving beyond crypto as an asset class and into crypto as a product and tool for user engagement. Crypto needs to expand its footprint and bring in the next wave of on-chain activity.\" - Vanessa Pestritto, director of partner programs at Agoric OpCo, a JavaScript-native smart contract platform and proof-of-stake blockchain.Layer-2 Flows\"The influx of activity on layer-2 chains has comparatively fizzled out during the midpoint of the year with most of the liquidity staying confined in the Ethereum mainnet. As a result, the DeFi protocols residing natively on layer-2 chains have seen an outflow of liquidity for a large part of the year. However, as gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet rise in line with spikes in activity, a part of the new capital will be flowing to the Layer-2 chains as their new home next year.\" - CCData outlook report, from the digital-assets data and analytics firm previously known as CryptoCompare.(Or maybe, alternatively, or simultaneously) Layer-2 consolidation\"Ethereum will implement EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), which will reduce transaction fees and improve scalability for layer-2 chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and others. Within one year of the upgrade, Ethereum L2s will consolidate down to two-to-three dominant players as measured by value and usage.\" - Mathew Sigel, head of digital assets research, VanEck.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

That’s likely to increase next year, with Ethereum well placed to benefit, says Cristiano Ventricelli, of Moody’s. ", "article body": "Digital finance technologies hold a lot of transformative potential. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) – of which blockchain is the best known example – powers digital bond issuances that, in time, could lessen the need for intermediaries in the issuance process, thereby improving operational efficiency and potentially reducing costs. DLT also underlies tokenization of real world assets, which could increase accessibility of certain instruments.However, to make these potential benefits a reality and gain wider adoption, in Moody’s view, DLT-based technologies and platforms will need to overcome several key hurdles, including a lack of interoperability and standardization among DLT systems, a lack of reliable digital cash options, regulatory uncertainty and technology risks.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package.In the last few months, an increasing number of institutions have begun to engage with permissionless blockchain via both pilot studies and real transactions. Many of these entities gravitate towards Ethereum, given its extensive ecosystem of applications and networks that have developed their own user base and product offering in the last few years. As an open-source public blockchain, Ethereum provides a blockchain base layer on top of which developers can build solutions for sharing data and value across other networks.Ethereum’s flexible design and its multi-year plan for upgrades, including ones that will improve interoperability, have made it a popular platform for digital bond issuances. Large institutions such as the European Investment Bank have issued bonds on Ethereum,  which was also the blockchain underlying a digital green bonds Moody’s rated in 2023, a €10 million senior unsecured digital green bond issued by Société Générale. Over time, in Moody’s view, public blockchain networks like Ethereum and traditional infrastructure will be more interlinked, which will enhance blockchains’ use cases, promoting industry growth.UnmuteAsset tokenization – converting an asset such as a fund, real estate or art into a digital token, making it storable and transferable using DLT – has been gaining ground in the past year. Total value of tokenized real world assets on public blockchains increased to $2 billion from $1 billion in the last 12 months, and Ethereum currently hosts the vast majority of it. One factor slowing the adoption of tokenization is a lack of a reliable form of digital cash, which has led market participants to settle transactions off-chain or use stablecoins.Stablecoins, a cryptocurrency whose price is pegged to a reference asset, such as fiat currency, are a form of digital cash, but under stressed market conditions stablecoins have not always maintained their peg. However, two other forms of digital cash that could address the present vulnerabilities of stablecoins are tokenized bank deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The development of tokenized bank deposits and CBDCs will continue to progress in 2024, in Moody’s view, although their degree of interaction with public blockchains is still unclear.Legal clarity will also likely improve in 2024, in Moody’s view, as regulators progress in developing frameworks to support new digital assets and services, although not all regions are advancing at the same pace. Regions including the EU, Singapore and the UAE could all attract new investors as a result of new customer and investor protections and new licensing regimes for digital assets. The U.S., meanwhile, will likely continue to use regulatory enforcement actions to establish legal precedent within the digital asset marketplace, as development of a digital asset framework in the U.S. remains a more distant goal.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

This year marks a significant shift, not only in technological adoption and innovation but also in the regulatory landscape that governs these digital assets.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package. Yiannis Giokas is a senior director with Moody’s Analytics.UnmuteNavigating the complex regulatory terrainThe stablecoin market in 2023 has undergone a transformation, driven by significant advancements in regulation. Given that the U.S. is by far the primary market for stablecoins, the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) recommendations, advocating for comprehensive regulation and oversight of global stablecoin arrangements have proven to be a pivotal moment. These guidelines aim to foster a unified approach to managing stablecoins within the international financial system, highlighting their potential impact on global financial stability.Elsewhere, the G-20 discussions earlier in the year revealed a split in perspectives, especially among emerging economies, over concerns about the disruptive potential of stablecoins on sovereign monetary policies. This led to calls for stringent regulatory frameworks, reflecting the need to balance financial innovation with national economic safeguards. In October, the G20 adopted a crypto roadmap to coordinate a global policy framework for crypto assets, including stablecoins, which will also take into consideration implications for emerging markets.In the U.K., the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England (BoE) are working towards finalizing regulations by 2025, indicating a commitment to safely integrating stablecoins into the financial ecosystem. Similarly, the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation sets a high benchmark for stablecoin oversight, with specific capital and liquidity requirements for issuers.The United States is also taking legislative strides with various proposals to regulate stablecoins. A comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework positions Japan ahead of other jurisdictions. Singapore's Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has finalized its framework for single currency stablecoins, and Hong Kong is preparing to introduce a regulatory framework by the end of 2024.A tumultuous yearIt has been a rollercoaster year for the stablecoin market. It started with the announcement that U.S.-dollar backed Binance-branded BUSD would no longer be minted, nor supported into 2024, leading to a search for reliable alternatives.Then major stablecoins including USDC and DAI experienced de-pegging events during a banking crisis in March, raising concerns about their reliability. Binance's endorsement of trueUSD (TUSD) and tether (USDT) maintaining their status as “trusted” stablecoins despite regulatory and transparency challenges, marked significant moments in the market's evolution.It's clear that the stablecoin market is at a crucial junctureMoody’s Analytics published a report that highlighted that large fiat-backed stablecoins depegged 600+ times in 2023, which futher encapsulated the volatility in the market.Adoption in mainstream financial operationsThis year, major companies like Visa, Mastercard and Checkout.com have embraced stablecoins for various applications. Visa expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities and initiated pilot programs with Circle’s USDC using the Solana blockchain. Mastercard collaborated with Immersve to enable crypto payments in New Zealand and Australia.Checkout.com launched a stablecoin settlement solution, offering merchants 24/7 settlement flexibility, even on weekends and holidays.Looking aheadAs we navigate through 2023, it's clear that the stablecoin market is at a crucial juncture. The regulatory landscapes across the globe reflect a concerted effort to integrate stablecoins safely into the financial system. While these regulatory efforts vary in approach and scope, they share a common goal: harnessing the potential of stablecoins while mitigating associated risks.Despite facing significant challenges, the market has shown resilience and adaptability. The evolution of stablecoins seems to be leaning towards enhanced regulatory compliance and a gradual shift towards more transparent, decentralized models. This promises a more secure and stable future for this crucial sector of the crypto economy.This year has been pivotal for stablecoins, marked by a broader regulatory push aimed at ensuring their stability and security. Despite some challenges and market fluctuations, the uptake and integration of stablecoins into both the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance indicate their increasing importance and potential for continued growth and innovation.As we move forward, the stablecoin market's trajectory points toward a future where these digital assets play an integral role in the broader financial landscape. In this regard, stablecoin issuers would be wise in 2024 to focus on transparency, risk management and putting in place proper controls in order to enhance trust and safeguards around the integrity of redemptions."},

They’re not alone; with all the hype around burgeoning ecosystems on Ethereum and Solana, it’s easy to write Bitcoin off as old, obsolete and boring.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package. Matt Luongo is the CEO of Thesis, a venture studio and auditing firm which has built a family of projects across fintech, DeFi, infrastructure, and zero-knowledge cryptography such as Fold, tBTC, and Embody.But that would be a mistake. In 2024, the world is going to be reminded of this in a big way. Next year will see the revenge of Bitcoin, for better or for worse.My ambivalence may surprise you. I haven’t changed my mind about the transformative power of Bitcoin. But 2024 is looking like the year this asset finally breaks into the mainstream in an irreversible way. And the nature of that transition will determine whether the dream of decentralization and self-custody of assets moves closer to reality, or if the Bitcoin “brand” is co-opted as just another product from the likes of Vanguard and Amazon.The catalyst for this is the impending approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which is poised to unleash a tidal wave of investment in the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.Here’s the problem: the inflow of new investors will be people who think they’ve invested in BTC, but never touch anything that actually lives on-chain. These ETFs will be “paper Bitcoin:” a representation, not the real thing, just like a dollar bill isn’t the same thing as gold.For Bitcoin to succeed on its own terms, it must evolve as a technology, not just a store of valueAnd there will be no obvious reason for anyone to hold the underlying asset directly. There will be a whole universe of consumer apps letting people buy, sell, trade, lend, borrow — all using synthetic assets that never touch the blockchain.“Bitcoin” will thrive, but the whole idea behind it, true self-custody, will be dead. How do we avoid a pyrrhic victory of this magnitude? By giving first-time HODLers something to do.Bitcoin has always been the largest digital asset in terms of market cap. But it has not been the epicenter of innovation for years when it comes to use cases. In that sphere, Ethereum has dominated, recently joined by other popular chains such as Solana. This has led many, implicitly or explicitly, to think of Bitcoin as “done” — a finished product with enduring value but little room for growth or evolution.We must shatter this myth. For Bitcoin to succeed on its own terms, it must evolve as a technology, not just a store of value. The stage for this has already been set by the rapid development of layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network, which have seen broad adoption over the past year.Yet just as Lightning shows what is possible, it is also a reminder of how much still needs to be done. In its current form, it has real limitations. For instance, when fees are high, performance suffers dramatically, seen recently when Lightning transaction facilitator Nostr Assets was recently forced to pause deposits due to overwhelming demand.The fact is Bitcoin’s current L2s do not yet have the capacity to onboard the next billion users. The primary thing a Bitcoin L2 should do is bring Bitcoin holders into “multiplayer mode.” A user shouldn’t need Cash App to send or receive BTC, they should be able to quickly and easily send value via email or through BTC-native apps like Nostr.The launch of ETFs will vastly expand Bitcoin’s adoption funnel. But to truly succeed, the underlying blockchain needs to be an arena of activity — a decentralized financial ecosystem where people can trade and build. More than anything, Bitcoin as a network should be an ecosystem where like-minded people can gather, trade, conduct business, and build.See also: BlackRock, Nasdaq, SEC Met Regarding Bitcoin ETFThis is already true for Ethereum, where it’s possible to make millions as a “degen,” but not yet for BTC. If the only thing you can do is to run a Lightning node, most people will never move beyond a brokerage account. Bitcoin must catch up with the DeFi ecosystems that have proliferated on other chains; the summer of 2024 needs to be BTC DeFi summer.Fortunately, 2023 has already shown that BTC isn't done innovating. As a project, as an idea and as a community, Bitcoin isn't finished. Developer talent, which many assumed had moved on to other pursuits, is coming back.Bitcoin is facing its greatest opportunity – and its greatest danger. The approval of ETFs will be the onboarding opportunity of our lifetimes. But if the infrastructure is not ready, the underlying promise of the technology will lose out to easy, convenient “paper” assets. The challenge for the community will be to build the infrastructure that can harness all this new activity to advance a future of decentralized, sound money for everyone.All of this is likely to blindside VCs and influencers like Marc Andreessen, but the story of Bitcoin is a story of surprising the naysayers."},
{"url": "https://www.coindesk.com:443/consensus-magazine/2023/12/14/crypto-friendly-does-not-mean-crypto-easy/", "article title": "Crypto-Friendly Does Not Mean Crypto-Easy", "article subtitle": "U.S. crypto regulation has much to learn from Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. But while these jurisdictions offer legal clarity around digital assets, they also have some of the toughest rules in the world, says CoinDesk’s Emily Parker. ", "article body": "A major theme of 2023 was Asia’s continued rise as a critically important region in the crypto world. This is largely thanks to well-known digital asset hubs like Singapore, as well as the re-emergence of Hong Kong and Japan. While these jurisdictions indeed welcome digital assets, the hype around them can be somewhat misleading. Places that are commonly referred to as “crypto-friendly” or “pro-crypto,” actually have some of the toughest rules in the world. Crypto-friendly does not mean crypto-easy.Singapore's crypto regulationSingapore got its pro-crypto reputation thanks to its early moves to regulate the industry and a consultative approach from its regulators. But while Singapore may be all in on asset tokenization, it’s actually not “crypto-friendly” at all. Singapore’s financial regulator basically said as much. Last year, Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, gave a talk called, \"Yes to Digital Asset Innovation, No to Cryptocurrency Speculation.” This year he went even further, saying that cryptocurrencies “have failed the test of digital money.” Menon argued that cryptocurrencies have not performed well as a medium of exchange or a store of value. He also pointed to sharp speculative swings and significant losses by crypto investors.It’s not just talk, either. Last year MAS issued guidelines to discourage crypto trading by the general public, which included prohibiting crypto service providers from advertising in public areas. By contrast, Singapore regulators are extremely enthusiastic about the tokenization of funds such as foreign exchange and bonds.Hong Kong's friendliness comes with conditionsThere’s also been a lot of excitement about Hong Kong’s re-emergence as a crypto hub. In June, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) started accepting license applications for crypto exchanges. Hong Kong appears to be more outwardly friendly to crypto trading than Singapore. Hong Kong regulators, for example, pushed banks to take on more cryptocurrency exchanges as clients.But again, this friendliness comes with a lot of conditions. Hong Kong still has only two licensed exchanges, with only spot trading and a limited list of tokens. Ninety-eight percent of an exchange’s assets must be held in cold wallets. Exchanges also must set up a legal entity for custody inside of Hong Kong. Operating an exchange in Hong Kong is neither simple nor cheap, as getting approved entails a team of lawyers, consultants and insurance providers. Getting a new license could cost anywhere between $12 and $20 million, CoinDesk reported.Japan's regulatory approachThen there’s Japan, whose ruling Liberal Democratic Party has been clear about its intention to make Japan a Web3 capital. “While many other countries are standing still and shrugging their shoulders in the face of the cold wind, Japan is positioned to play a unique role in the crypto industry,” read a 2022 proposal from Japan’s LDP project team. Japan is no stranger to cold winds. Following the Coincheck hack of early 2018, Japanese regulators were so tough on crypto that some feared the local industry was in crisis. But when FTX collapsed in November 2022, Japan’s regulatory approach led to a major win. Japan requires crypto exchanges to segregate exchange and customer assets, and this helped FTX Japan users actually get their money back.Japan also is among the first major economies to see stablecoin regulations go into effect, but it sets a very high bar. Only banks, trust companies and fund transfer services are allowed to issue stablecoins in Japan. The trust structure is likely to be a common path, but this requires that 100% of the assets backing the stablecoin to be kept in a trust in Japan, and are only permitted to be invested in domestic bank accounts. Given Japan’s low interest rates, this could make it very challenging for yen-based stablecoins to be profitable. But in the end, Japan’s biggest obstacle to being a destination for crypto entrepreneurs may be high taxes.Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan have something important in common. They might not be easy on crypto, but they are relatively clear. Exchanges have an idea of what they can and can not do. Regulators in all three jurisdictions have put in the time to craft comprehensive regulatory frameworks and have also demonstrated willingness to engage with the industry. In other words, you may not like the rules, but at least you know how to find them.Lessons for the United StatesThis approach poses a stark contrast to the United States. Crypto advocates often criticize the U.S. government, and more specifically SEC Chair Gary Gensler, for being unfriendly toward crypto. The larger problem is not that regulations are too harsh, it’s that people are still arguing about what is a security and what is a commodity.UnmuteThe result is that in the absence of a national crypto framework, people look for clarity in court decisions. The SEC has levied complaint after complaint. Many in the industry looked to the Ripple court decision in the hope that it would set a clarifying precedent. But not all companies have the time and capital to spend years battling the SEC in court. The crypto environment in the United States is decidedly unfriendly, but it’s not because the rules are too strict. It’s because no one agrees on what they are.Global crypto regulations are clearly trending toward strictness, as we will see when Europe’s MICA takes effect next year. The extensive regulations for the 27 member states of the European Union, covering about 450 million people, are going to be anything but lax. And yes, it is possible to be too strict. That’s why it’s so important for regulators to be flexible and open to talking to the industry, so that they can make appropriate changes if overbearing rules are making it impossible for businesses to thrive.It may be time to retire the term “crypto-friendly,” which gives the impression of ease. A more accurate term is crypto-clear. If and when the crypto market fully revives, that clarity will give places like Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan a distinct advantage.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

But history suggests that might not be the case, says Frank Corva, at Finder.com. ", "article body": "It’s that time again — when your friends and family members who know you’re into Bitcoin text asking if now is the time to buy.A time that signifies we’re at another peak in bitcoin’s price.I know, I know. How bah-humbug of me.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package.But the truth is, if you’re thinking about buying bitcoin right now, it might not be the best time to make a sizable purchase — despite the fact that we might see spot bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) approved in the near future (possibly as early as January).Why?Let’s start by looking at bitcoin’s price action during periods leading up to the last two Bitcoin halvings. (The next is due in late-April, when block 840,000 is expected to be mined.)Trends from previous Bitcoin cyclesBitcoin halving cycles last about four years (210,000 blocks produced at approximately 10 minutes per block). At the commencement of each cycle, the block subsidy reward that Bitcoin miners receive is cut in half, which triggers a bitcoin supply shock.Historically, bitcoin’s price has risen dramatically during the year and a half that follows the halving. The price then tanks and trades in a range for the cycle’s other two and a half years.From late-2013 until mid-2016, when the second halving occurred, bitcoin’s price fell from $1,166 to $156. It then rebounded to $780 — 67% of the previous all-time high — before falling 40% to $472 in August 2016.The $472 price point marked a local bottom just one month after the second halving took place.From late 2017 to late 2018, bitcoin’s price fell from $19,666 to $3,150 before rebounding to $13,882 — 70% of the previous all-time high. By March 2020, its price had fallen 72% to $3,867.$3,867 marked a local bottom two months before the third Bitcoin halving, which occurred in May 2020.Another two-and-a-half-year period that precedes a Bitcoin halving is coming to an end. This period began in late 2021 and will end in April 2024, when the fourth halving is scheduled to occur.During this period thus far, bitcoin’s price has fallen from $69,000 to $15,522 before rebounding to $44,759 — 65% of the previous all-time high.This 65% rebound — the current one — is awfully close to the 67% and 70% rebounds we saw in the two previous cycles.And so the big question now is: Will bitcoin’s price retrace significantly leading up to the next halving as it has leading up to the two previous halvings?If bitcoin’s price were to fall 40% from these current levels — as it did in 2015-2016 — we’d see bitcoin’s price at $26,855. (As of writing, it is approaching $44,000).If it were to fall 72% — as in 2019-2020 — we’d see bitcoin’s price at $12,532.I’ve seen very few people mention such numbers in the wake of the euphoria bitcoin investors are currently experiencing.So, will this time be different?Aren’t we waiting for billions of dollars to flow into bitcoin almost immediately after the spot bitcoin ETF is approved?Maybe.The spot bitcoin ETFNo one knows whether an approval of a spot bitcoin ETF is priced into the bitcoin market yet.Some believe it is and that the announcement of a spot bitcoin ETF will be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event — a situation in which bitcoin’s price rises in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF announcement, as it has been, but then sells off once the ETF is announced.Others say it’s a “buy the rumor, buy the news” event — a situation in which bitcoin’s price rises in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF and rises again once the ETF is announced.The truth is that no one knows what will happen in the wake of a spot bitcoin ETF being approved and coming to market.And with Bloomberg analysts predicting a 90% chance of approval by January 10, 2024, hardly anyone seems to be asking the following question: What happens to bitcoin’s price if the spot bitcoin ETF isn’t approved? (Though CoinDesk did.)This scenario could easily be grounds for a significant drawdown in bitcoin’s price. The drawdown might not be as severe as the previous two, but it would likely be notable.Also, what happens to bitcoin’s price in the event of a hard landing?UnmuteWhat if we don’t get a soft landing?While the powers that be and major institutions will have you believe that we’re on our way to a soft landing or, at worst, a mild recession, those of us who remember hearing the exact same rhetoric in 2008 aren’t so convinced.A number of reputable outlets have stated that we may be amid a “melt-up” — a situation in which asset prices rise parabolically before crashing catastrophically.This isn’t hard to believe given that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at an all-time high, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are almost there, as well — all while we’re still in an environment in which investors can earn over 5% risk-free in money market mutual funds.If a melt-up is currently taking place and bitcoin’s price is going along for the ride, then there are two more questions we have to ask: How high does bitcoin’s price rise before it comes crashing down, and what sort of investing strategy is best to employ if this is the case?While the first question is difficult to answer, the second isn’t as challenging.A BTC investment strategy for this point in the Bitcoin cycleBy all means, continue to HODL your BTC and DCA (dollar-cost average) into the asset, as these investment strategies have proven fruitful for anyone who has held BTC for more than four years.The one thing you might want to avoid amid this euphoria is aping into a large position at these levels — especially with any sort of leverage. (To quote the Founder & CEO of Custodia Bank, Caitlin Long, “A fool and their leveraged bitcoin are soon parted.”)If we see a massive drawdown in bitcoin’s price, you’ll want to have some cash on the sidelines to buy, not find yourself bitcoin-less and cash-strapped due to acting like an overzealous gambler.As always, we don’t know where bitcoin’s price will go from here. Maybe it actually will move up only both into and beyond the halving.But if history repeats itself and bitcoin performs the way it has right before prior halvings, we may see bitcoin at a significantly lower price as the halving in April 2024 approaches.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

NFT brands are selling products in major brick-and-mortar and online retailers. We’re seeing the launch of major blockchain-based games. And more established companies are coming into the NFT space. As a result, NFT-based brand building is poised to be a significant driver of Web3 adoption in 2024.The next wave of successful NFT products will likely look quite different from much of what we've seen before. Instead of focusing on a small quantity of high-value assets, many of these products will be produced in large quantities – and sold at more affordable prices, targeting the broader consumer market. They'll be focused on direct value creation, rather than speculation. And many customers will acquire and use these digital assets without even realizing they're running on crypto rails.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package. The Everything Token is available for preorder now, and will be in stores on January 23, 2024.We’ve already seen experiments with mass-market NFTs as digital collectibles, from the likes of Nike, Reddit, Starbucks – and yes, even former U.S. President Donald Trump. And, similarly, NFT-native brands like Pudgy Penguins, Cool Cats, and Kitaro Studios have produced “phygital” activations, whereby a physical product comes with an associated NFT, either linked to the product directly or through a claim code delivered at the point-of-sale. In parallel, both major players like Ticketmaster and newcomers like tokenproof and YellowHeart have been testing out NFTs for event tickets, memberships, and other forms of fan engagement.These sorts of products give an opportunity for consumers who aren’t familiar with NFTs to experience the digital ownership that comes with this novel tech. They’re typically sold at what we might think of as “normal” consumer product prices – tickets cost what they would normally cost; phygital prices are generally comparable to ordinary prices for just the physical object.While early entry into NFTs required users to navigate complicated self-custodial wallets, these NFTs often come wrapped in a platform design that submerges the underlying blockchain technology through a partially or fully custodial wallet system. Yet this doesn’t stop consumers from receiving utility from the tokens and integrating them into their digital identity on social media and other platforms. Nor does it stop them from participating in the broader NFT ecosystem if they want to (indeed, in many cases, they can even transfer their branded NFTs to self-custody if they so choose).Meanwhile, making digital assets more accessible – both technologically and in terms of price – expands the potential market dramatically, and provides a foundation brands can build upon.As we describe in a book coming out in January, The Everything Token (you can preorder here), NFTs give a company or creator a way to benefit from the power of decentralized value creation by turning their customers into a community: the asset itself establishes a network linking holders to the brand and each other; at the same time, ownership incentivizes consumers themselves to share the brand with others and help build it.UnmuteStarbucks Odyssey members, for example, have set up entire third-party websites dedicated to the program and organized unofficial meetups and events without direct involvement from Starbucks. This has also extended into the digital realm, as members have spun their own group chats up with friends from the public Starbucks server, meaning community members who wouldn’t know each other without these NFTs now stay connected daily in both the digital and physical world.This can be just as effective for small businesses and solo creators as it is for major companies. But it works best when the community can be broad and growing.For a brand like Starbucks or Nike to get the most out of their NFT products, they have to eventually be able to bring those products to their full global customer base. Conversely, whenever a customer wants to become part of the brand’s digital ecosystem, they need to be able to. (This is, if anything, even more true for businesses with a more local following.)This implies that the smaller, more broadly accessible NFT products we’ve been seeing aren’t just experiments – they’re the future. The success of “open edition” creator NFTs in early 2023 illustrated how effective this strategy can be for creators. And over the course of the year, it’s been clear that businesses have been figuring it out, too.So we’re expecting to see brands go big with “small” NFTs in 2024. And as they do so, they’re likely to bring many more consumers into the space.Disclosures: Both Kaczynski and Kominers hold digital assets, including fungible and non-fungible tokens from some of the companies mentioned.

So, it was highly ironic yesterday that the SEC was itself the victim of that very threat.A tweet from the SEC’s X (Twitter) account appeared at roughly 4 p.m. ET to say the agency had approved the first application, only for Chair Gary Gensler to shortly say thereafter that the news was untrue and the X account had been hacked.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.\"The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted,\" Gensler wrote on his personal account. \"The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\"Someone, unknown as yet, had gotten hold of the phone number the SEC uses for its account verification and, according to the “Safety” team at X, the SEC did not have two-factor verification on its X.Crypto Twitter had a field day, with many high-profile commenters pointing out the double standard.The price of bitcoin (BTC) briefly rose on the news (above $47,500) only to fall before its level at the time of the fake news (below $45,000). There was a flood of liquidations, as CoinDesk reported. This may indicate how a real announcement – expected today – might play market-wise. An exchange-traded fund announcement may be a “sell-the-news” event and the huge price rises we’ve seen in the last few months could be based on excessive expectations for the leading crypto.Maybe, the SEC’s gaffe proves its point: nascent, unregulated markets are susceptible to malevolent actors.

Wouldn’t you?Read more: Did the Fake Bitcoin ETF Announcement Prove an SEC Approval Is a 'Sell-the-News' Event? This isn’t the first time fake ETF announcement news has moved markets. Cointelegraph’s erroneous tweet in October also pushed bitcoin higher. Both episodes show the huge pent-up demand for this announcement to break. Many in crypto see billions of dollars coming into the space once institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, which have applications pending, get firmly into the space. Many see parallels with the introduction of gold ETFs in the early 2000s, which sent the price of gold skyrocketing, at least in the long term.We’ll know soon enough what the impact is going to be. My guess is that we’ll see a short pump in the price before things settle down again as normalcy sets in. There’s something about expectation being more exciting than reality, and that seems like the case here.After all, ETFs are just standard investment products, not manna sent from heaven. Once people realize that, we might see a slow uptick in demand and price action for bitcoin, but not a flood of all-time-high milestones. Gold, if you check, didn’t suddenly become a mainstream investment; it took years. And, it’s likely to be the same with bitcoin. Still, the hype around the ETF announcement shows how many people out there want a positive narrative to move bitcoin higher. That, rather than the actual impact of ETFs, may be the important point here. Whatever the fundamentals, there’s huge demand for positive news in crypto after the falls, crashes and scandals of the last 18 months.Edited by Daniel Kuhn."},

It was a year when artificial intelligence, a concept once relegated to the pages of science fiction, blossomed into a multifaceted tool, fluent in the diverse tongues of humanity. Like the fabled Tower of Babel in reverse, it bridged languages, bringing us closer to a universal understanding.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package.In this same year, blockchain technology, akin to the invisible yet foundational forces of the universe, worked its way quietly into our digital cosmos. It provided a secure bedrock for our virtual possessions, all the while sparing us the labyrinthine complexities of its inner workings.As for virtual worlds, they've seen a big turnaround in 2023. After the initial excitement and then the letdown of the metaverse in 2022, things started looking up again. This change came thanks to advancements by hardware companies. It's like we're on the brink of getting the “iPhone of Spatial Computing,” something that could really bring these digital worlds to life in ways we can touch and feel.These developments, while distinct in their own right, did not occur in isolation. They represent the emerging threads of Technological Convergence – a concept where separate technological paths begin to intersect and influence one another, creating a unified tapestry of innovation. This convergence is more than just a blending of technologies; it is a harmonization that enhances, expands, and redefines our experience of the digital world.As we step into 2024, we find ourselves at the precipice of this new era, where the seamless integration of AI, blockchain and virtual reality heralds a future of limitless potential and unprecedented digital interaction.UnmuteThe convergence of AI and the metaverseIntriguingly, this convergence is rooted in the very hardware that powers it. GPUs, known for rendering rich virtual spaces, are the same workhorses that train AI models. Their capability for parallel computing not only makes them invaluable in AI development but also in bringing to life the complex environments of the Metaverse. This synergy is evident in the surging value of GPU manufacturers like Nvidia, highlighting the intertwined growth of AI and virtual reality technologies.Going into 2024, the convergence of AI and the metaverse looms as a pivotal development in our technological journey. We are on the cusp of witnessing AI transform the act of creation within the metaverse. This year, we predict that AI will evolve beyond its current capabilities, enabling creators to craft expansive virtual worlds merely through the power of description. The metaverse will no longer require intricate skills in 3D modeling and animation; instead, it will respond to the creative impulses of human thought, brought to life by AI.The trust architecture of tomorrowThe year 2023 was a crucible for blockchain, with the industry navigating through legal challenges and corporate upheavals. These trials, reminiscent of the growing pains of any great technological advancement, heralded blockchain's maturation. Amid this legal maelstrom, the essence of blockchain – the digitization of asset ownership – stood resolute and unscathed, continuing its march towards technological revolution.We foresee blockchain melding into the internet's fabric, akin to the unseen yet vital protocols that power our emails and instant messages. This convergence will see blockchain assets become a native dialect for the digital realm, essential, and most importantly, invisible to the user. The interaction with blockchain will be as effortless as sending an email, its complexities hidden, its efficacy and security omnipresent. In this future, blockchain is not just a technology; it is a silent orchestrator of digital trust and ownership.Synergies between VR and the MetaverseIn 2023, virtual reality (VR) has ascended to become the next frontier in human-computer interaction, providing unprecedented bandwidth for digital communication and embodying the essence of presence. This leap forward has been propelled by advancements from leading hardware manufacturers, with the release of Meta Quest 3 and the eagerly anticipated VR headsets from Apple and Nintendo. Each stride in this domain is not just about technological progress; it is about redefining our very perception of and interaction with digital realms.Looking ahead to 2024, we stand on the brink of a defining moment in the spatial computing industry. The potential use case of experiencing events like the NBA finals from the best seats in the stadium, all from the comfort of home, is poised to capture the imagination of the masses. This experience, bridging the physical and digital worlds, will likely be a catalyst for widespread adoption among the early majority. The journey ahead for VR is long and filled with potential, but the convergence of technologies like AI, blockchain, and advanced hardware is setting the stage for a seismic shift.The cultural and economic impactIn the narrative of our digital evolution, Generation Z emerges as the vanguard of a new cultural epoch. Born into a world where virtuality is as real as the air they breathe, these digital natives are the first to fully immerse themselves in the fruits of technological convergence. Their initial forays, playful and experimental in creating memes and digital artifacts, are but the prologue to a deeper, more significant shift. With tools shaped by AI and the metaverse at their fingertips, they are not just using technology; they are reshaping it, bending the digital universe to their imagination and whims.We see these young minds not just embracing but mastering the art of creation within these new realms. They are the pioneers of a world where user-generated content is not just a pastime but a new economic frontier. In their hands, creativity and innovation become more than expression; they are the keys to unlocking new forms of value and influence. The power once held by a select few in coding and legal intricacies is now democratized in the hands of these youthful creators, heralding a future where the digital realm is limited only by imagination.In 2024As 2024 unfolds, we are at the cusp of a transformative era in technology. The integration of AI, blockchain, and virtual reality is crafting a new digital landscape. This convergence is more than a mere amalgamation of technologies; it's a revolution in how we interact with the digital realm. AI's advancement is redefining creative possibilities in the metaverse, enabling environments to be molded by thought alone. Blockchain evolves into a fundamental layer of digital trust, making asset ownership seamlessly part of the internet's fabric. Virtual reality, on the brink of a breakthrough, is set to radically change our sensory experiences in digital spaces.Crucially, this technological synergy is the playground of Generation Z, who are not just users but active creators and shapers of these realms. Their engagement with these technologies is not just about leisure; it's the forging of a new economic and cultural landscape where imagination is the primary currency.In this new era, the limits of the digital world are defined only by our creativity, opening unprecedented avenues for innovation and interaction. The year 2024 marks the beginning of this exciting journey, promising a future where technology and imagination converge to expand the boundaries of what is possible.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

", "article body": "This past year has been a testament to the blockchain space’s ability to recover from even the harshest external conditions. From the depths of the “crypto winter” at the beginning of the year, the overall market cap of the crypto space has grown by 90% to $1.69 trillion, with bitcoin more than doubling from its yearly low of $16k in Jan 2023 to over $40k in December.This post is part of CoinDesk's \"Crypto 2024\" predictions package.In 2023, we’ve continued to feel some of the aftershocks of the wave of major collapses in 2022, most notably the FTX trial and verdict and the Binance plea deal in November, as well as the momentary depegging of the USDC stablecoin in March amid the banking crisis. At the same time, we’ve continued to see breakthroughs in the space, including the Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade to a full Proof-of-Stake network, also in March, the ruling that XRP was (mostly) not a security in July, the launch of PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin and Grayscale’s win over the SEC for the Bitcoin spot ETF in August, and the pioneering of novel tokenized social experiences such as the rise of Friend.tech.We thus enter 2024 with a great optimism on the road ahead. Here are my top predictions for crypto industry in 2024:1. The resurgence of Bitcoin and “DeFi Summer 2.0”In 2023, Bitcoin has staged a comeback, with bitcoin dominance (Bitcoin’s proportion of crypto market cap) rising from 38% in January to around 50% in December, making it one of the top ecosystems to look out for in 2024. There are at least three major catalysts driving its renaissance in the next year: (1) the fourth Bitcoin halving due for April 2024, (2) the expected approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs from institutional investors, and (3) a rise in programmability features, both on the base protocol (such as Ordinals), as well as Layer 2s and other scalability layers such as Stacks and Rootstock.On the infrastructure level, we believe we will see a proliferation of Bitcoin L2s and other scalability layer to support smart contracts. The Bitcoin ecosystem should coalesce around one or two Turing-complete smart contract languages, with top contenders including Rust, Solidity, or the extension of a Bitcoin-native language such as Clarity. This language will become the “standard” for Bitcoin development, similar to how Solidity is considered to be the “standard” for Ethereum development.UnmuteWe also see the fundamentals for a possible “DeFi summer 2.0” on Bitcoin. With Wrapped BTC (WBTC) today having a market cap and Total Value Locked (TVL) of around $6 billion, there is clearly an enormous demand for Bitcoin in DeFi. Today, Ethereum has about 10% of its $273 billion market cap in TVL ($28 billion). As Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure matures, we could potentially see Bitcoin DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) rise from the current $300M (<0.05% of market cap) to ~1-2% of Bitcoin market cap (~$10-15 billion at current prices). In this process, many Ethereum DeFi practices are likely to be transferred and “naturalized” on Bitcoin, such as the recent rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and ideas such as staking such as in Babylon’s L2.Bitcoin NFTs, such as those inscribed on Ordinals, may also see increased popularity in 2024. As Bitcoin has much higher cultural recognition and memetic value, it is possible that web2 brands (such as luxury retailers) will choose to release NFTs on Bitcoin, similar to how Tiffanys partnered with Cryptopunks to release the “NFTiff” pendants collection in 2022.2. Tokenized social experiences for new consumer use casesWhereas Web2 has moved from social to finance, Web3 is moving from finance to social. In August 2023, friend.tech pioneered a new form of tokenized social experiences on the Base L2, with users able to buy and sell fractionalized “shares” of others’ X (fka. Twitter) accounts, reaching a peak of 30k ETH TVL (~$50 million USD at the time) in October, and inspiring several “copycat projects” such as post.tech on Arbitrum. It seems that friend.tech, through financializing Twitter profiles, has successfully pioneered a new tokenomics model for the SocialFi space.Read more: Amanda Cassatt - How Asia Drives the Next Crypto Bull MarketIn the upcoming year, we expect more experiments in the social space, with tokenization (both as fungible and non-fungible tokens) playing a key role in reinventing the social experience. Fungible tokens are more likely to be novel forms of points and loyalty systems, whereas non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are more likely to serve as profiles and social resources (such as trading cards). Both would be able to be traded on-chain and participate in DeFi ecosystems.Lens and Farcaster are two of the leading web3-native applications integrating DeFi with social networks. Projects like Blackbird will also popularize tokenized points systems for loyalty programs in specific verticals (such as restaurants), using a combination of stablecoin payments and tokenized rebates to reinvent the consumer experience, functionally providing an on-chain alternative to credit cards.3. An increase in TradFi-DeFi “bridges” such as stablecoins and mirrored assets2023 has seen a lot of legal action in crypto, including several high profile wins for the industry such as the XRP ruling and the Grayscale ETF litigation win, and justice being served for financial fraud in Binance and FTX. Alongside this is a large increase in institutional interest and potential ETF approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum.In 2024, we expect to see a dramatic increase in institutional adoption, who not only seek for ETFs, but also tokenized real-world assets (RWA) and TradFi financial products. In other words, TradFi assets will be “mirrored” in DeFi, while crypto assets will have increased exposure in TradFi markets, thus creating TradFi-DeFi “bridges” that bring these two worlds closer together for increased liquidity and diversification for investors.Stablecoins will serve as one of the most important links between the TradFi and DeFi worlds, with stablecoins such as USDC and PYUSD being more widely accepted as both portfolio options and payment tools. With Circle said to consider a 2024 IPO, we also may see an increase in the issuance and usage of non-USD stablecoins, most notably Euro-backed stablecoins such as Circle’s EURC, as well as British Pound, Singaporean Dollar, and Japanese Yen stablecoins. Some of these stablecoins may be launched by state-backed actors. This may also lead to the growth of an on-chain fiat foreign exchange market. Tokenized treasuries have already gained traction with $800m tokenized through platforms like Ondo.4. The cross-pollination of modular blockchains and Zero Knowledge ProofsBoth the idea of modular blockchains and ZKPs have greatly matured over this past year, such as the recent Celestia mainnet launch, Espresso’s Arbitrum integration, RiscZero’s open-source Zeth prover, and Succinct’s launch of a ZK marketplace. One interesting trend is how these two narratives have merged together, with companies in the ZK space “modularizing” by focusing on specific verticals, such as co-processors, privacy layers, proof marketplaces, and zkDevOps.In the upcoming year, I expect this trend to continue, with Zero Knowledge Proofs emerging as an interface between different components of the modular blockchain stack. For example, Axiom’s ZK co-processor leverages ZKPs to provide historical state proofs, which can then be used by developers to perform computations in DApps. With ZKPs being the common interface between these different providers, we will see a new era of smart contract composability. This provides developers building DApps with a far greater flexibility for providers and reduces the barrier to entry for the blockchain stack. On the consumer side, ZKPs may see increased use cases as a way to preserve identity and privacy, such as in the form of ZK-based decentralized IDs.5. More computationally intensive applications moving on-chain, such as AI and DePINThere has been a lot of time, energy, and capital poured into the scalability problem for decentralized applications. Today, much of the scalability problem has been solved – gas fees on Ethereum L2s are less than 0.02 USD (compared to 11.5 USD for Ethereum mainnet), and on Solana the fees are 3-4 orders of magnitude even lower.Read more: Marc Hochstein - What Prediction Markets Are Forecasting for Crypto in 2024As this trend continues in the next year, we believe computationally expensive applications (applications can use up gigabytes of RAM) will become much more economically feasible on-chain in the near future. This includes vertical applications such as on-chain AI systems, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), on-chain knowledge graphs, and fully on-chain games and social networks. All this may radically reshape the on-chain data economy, greatly improve both user and developer experience, as they are freed from onerous gas fees and stringent constraints on compute power.Examples of computationally expensive projects that can take advantage of this much cheaper on-chain “compute” include Hivemapper’s efforts to create a decentralized Google Maps on Solana, Bittensor’s creation of a decentralized machine learning platform, Modulus Labs’ efforts in ZKML and AI-generated NFT art, The Graph’s plans for on-chain knowledge graphs, and the Realmsverse creating an on-chain game world and lore on Starknet.6. Consolidation of public blockchain ecosystems and a “Hub-and-Spoke” model for appchainsThere has been a proliferation in infrastructure projects over the past few years. Despite the commonplace technical categorization of Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2), from a user experience perspective there is not much of a difference. This is especially true for a general-purpose public blockchains; today an L1 such as Solana or Avalanche is a direct competitor to an L2 such as Arbitrum or zkSync for users, projects, and volume.With this homogeneity in place, liquidity serves as a concentrating force for general-purpose public blockchains, benefiting larger incumbent players such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Solana, with the top four ecosystems today accounting for ~90% of Total Value Locked (TVL). Smaller ecosystems must concentrate their efforts on specific verticals (such as social, gaming, DeFi) to retain an edge, effectively becoming “appchains” or “sector-chains.” Already, three of the Top 10 L2s by TVL (dydx, Loopring, Ronin) are effectively appchains that specialize in a single vertical. The TVL “break-in” of smaller, newer L2 chains such as Base and Blast also rely heavily on single “killer-apps” (eg. friend.tech and Blur respectively) to establish beachheads in volume.Moreover, most leading general-purpose public blockchains have released appchain toolkits (OP Stack, Arbitrum Nitro, StarkEx, etc.) to allow appchains to tap into the liquidity on these public networks and place them within their ecosystem orbits. Thus, we’re beginning to see a “hub and spoke” model where there a few general-purpose public blockchains acting as central “hubs,” around which there are numerous “spokes” of specific appchains. In 2024, it may be worth paying attention to major rollup-as-a-service vendors such as Caldera, Conduit, and Eclipse that take advantage of this “hub-and-spoke” move.ConclusionAs we reach the end of 2023, we have perhaps made it through the worst of the bear market, turning over the page on the series of brutal collapses that we have seen over the past year and a half, and ready to begin exploring novel use cases. Today, we’re at an inflection point, where crypto is no longer solely about financialization, but rather a broader idea of how we redefine consumer, social, and developer experiences using blockchains. I’m very excited to see what 2024 holds for the future of our still nascent industry, as we use decentralized technologies to reimagine our digital culture.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

OpenAI’s early success drove a surge in investor interest for large language models (LLMs) and AI applications, attracting $25 billion in funding in 2023 (up 5x YoY!), in pursuit of the potential multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity.You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.As I’ve previously written, AI and crypto technologies complement each other well, so it’s not surprising to see a growing AI ecosystem emerging within Web3. Despite all the attention, I’ve noticed a lot of confusion about what these protocols do, what’s hype vs. real, and how they all fit together. This report will map out the Web3 AI supply chain, define each layer in the tech stack, and explore the various competitive landscapes. By the end you should have a basic understanding of how the ecosystem works and what to look out for next.Web3’s AI tech stackInfrastructure LayerGenerative AI is powered by LLMs, which run on high-performance GPUs. LLMs have three main workloads: training (model creation), fine-tuning (sector/topic specialization) and inference (running the model). I’ve segmented this layer into general-purpose GPU, ML-specific GPU, and GPU aggregators, which are characterized by their different workload capabilities and use-cases. These P2P marketplaces are crypto-incentivized to ensure secure decentralization, but it’s important to note the actual GPU processing occurs off-chain.General-purpose GPU: Crypto-incentivized (decentralized) marketplaces for GPU computing power which can be used for any type of application. Given its general-purpose nature, the computing resource is best suited for model inference only (the most used LLM workload). Early category leaders include Akash and Render, but, with many new entrants emerging, it’s unclear how protocol differentiation will play out. Although compute is technically a commodity, Web3 demand for permissionless, GPU-specific compute should continue to grow exponentially over the next decade-plus as we integrate AI more into our daily lives. Key long-term differentiators will be distribution and network effects.ML-specific GPU: These marketplaces are more specific to machine learning (ML) applications and can therefore be used for model training, fine-tuning, and inference. Unlike general-purpose marketplaces, these protocols can better differentiate through the overlay of ML-specific software, but distribution and network effects will also be key. Bittensor has an early lead, but many projects are launching soon.GPU Aggregators: These marketplaces aggregate GPU supply from the previous two categories, abstract away networking orchestration, and overlay with ML-specific software. They are like Web2 VARs (valued-added resellers) and can be thought of as product distributors. These protocols offer more complete GPU solutions that can run model training, fine-tuning, and inference. Io.net is the first protocol to emerge in the category, but I expect more competitors to emerge given the need for more consolidated GPU distribution.Middleware LayerThe previous layer enables permissionless access to GPUs, but middleware is needed to connect this computing resource to on-chain smart contracts in a trust-minimized manner (i.e., for use by Web3 applications). Enter zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic method by which one party (prover) can prove to another party (verifier) that a given statement is true, while avoiding conveying to the verifier any information beyond the fact of the statement’s truth. In our case, the “statement” is the LLMs output given specific input.Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Inference Verification: Decentralized marketplaces for ZKP verifiers to bid on the opportunity to verify (for compensation) that inference outputs are accurately produced by the desired LLM (while keeping the data and model parameters private). Although ZK technology has come a long way, ZK for machine-learning (zkML) is still early days and must get cheaper and faster to be practical. When it does, it has the potential to dramatically open the Web3 and AI design space, by allowing smart contracts to access LLMs in a decentralized manner. Although still early, =nil;, Giza, and RISC Zero lead developer activity on GitHub. Protocols like Blockless are well positioned whichever ZKP providers win since they act as aggregation & abstraction layers (ZKP distribution).Developer Tooling & Application Hubs: In addition to ZKPs, Web3 developers require tooling, software development kits (SDKs) and services to efficiently build applications like AI agents (software entities that carry out operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of autonomy, employing representation of the user's goals) and AI-powered automated trading strategies. Many of these protocols also double as application hubs, where users can directly access finished applications that were built on their platforms (application distribution). Early leaders include Bittensor, which currently hosts 32 different “subnets” (AI applications), and Fetch.ai, which offers a full-service platform for developing enterprise-grade AI agents.Application LayerAnd finally, at the top of the tech stack, we have user-interfacing applications that leverage Web3’s permissionless AI processing power (enabled by the previous two layers) to complete specific tasks for a variety of use-cases. This portion of the market is still nascent, and still relies on centralized infrastructure, but early examples include smart contract auditing, blockchain-specific chatbots, metaverse gaming, image generation, and trading and risk-management platforms. As the underlying infrastructure continues to advance, and ZKPs mature, next-gen AI applications will emerge with functionality that’s difficult to imagine today. It’s unclear if early entrants will be able to keep up or if new leaders will emerge in 2024 and beyond.Investor outlook: While I’m bullish on the whole AI tech stack, I believe infrastructure and middleware protocols are better investments today given the uncertainty in how AI functionality will evolve over time. However it does evolve, Web3 AI applications will no doubt require massive GPU power, ZKP technology, and developer tooling and services (i.e. infrastructure & middleware).Disclosure: M31 Capital has positions in several tokens mentioned in this article.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an omnibus decision today to approve a host of spot bitcoin ETF applications.More than 10 years after the first filing for a crypto-based exchange-traded fund, a type of financial product designed to track other assets like commodities and equities, the SEC has decided to approve the first ETFs that follow the spot market price of bitcoin.For full coverage of bitcoin ETFs, click here.Many analysts believe these products, introduced into the market by a host of Wall Street heavyweights including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck as well as a number of crypto native firms, could drive significant capital into bitcoin (BTC).See also: How to Buy a Bitcoin ETFLarry Fink, the CEO of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has said the firm filed to list a bitcoin ETF last year specifically because there was clear customer demand for something like it. That decision opened the floodgates, with a number of competing applications soon following.Bitcoin gained over 160% since that moment, based on the idea that if the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs, any number of retail investors and companies would choose to invest in bitcoin. Standard Chartered predicted that upwards of $100 billion could flow into bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. this year.All of this remains to be seen, but now, with the SEC’s decision to approve 11 of the 13 bitcoin ETF applications, the world will. CoinDesk spoke to a number of experts — traders, executives and analysts — to get their take on what this moment means for the entire crypto industry going forward.Sergey Nazarov, co-founder, Chainlink: \"Bitcoin ETF approval has made it clear that traditional financial institutions have a significant role to play in determining how the crypto markets evolve. This was evident when PayPal launched the ability to buy certain cryptocurrencies, and some banks started offering crypto custody. The approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF will lead to an influx of traditional large top-tier financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, which will likely actively participate in the crypto markets.\"Gavin Michael, CEO, Bakkt: \"Today's SEC approval of a spot BTC ETF represents a significant milestone for the industry, and it is my hope that it signals a new era of regulated crypto products offered by reputable, trusted crypto companies. This ETF approval has the potential to not only accelerate market adoption but also to foster lasting momentum within the industry. As we move forward with more ETF applications, it is essential for ETF providers to collaborate with qualified custodians who have a proven track record in safeguarding digital assets like BTC. This collaborative approach is crucial in reducing risks and creating a secure environment for investors.\"Kristin Smith, CEO, Blockchain Association: \"The approval of a Bitcoin ETF adds more pressure on Congress to pass fit-for-purpose legislation for the digital asset ecosystem. Consumer demand is poised to grow exponentially and those consumers, investors, and entrepreneurs deserve clear regulations that address many of the outstanding questions the industry has been urging our elected officials and regulators to answer.\"Read more: Why Is a Bitcoin ETF a Big Deal? The Gold Market Provides a $100 Billion AnswerJames Angel, associate professor, Georgetown University: \"If the SEC is anti-crypto, they have shot themselves in the head. If they had just quietly approved the Grayscale ETF application all those many years ago, there would be a few crypto ETFs out there without much fanfare. By delaying as long as they have, they are creating a lot more free publicity for crypto. Also, they appear to be consciously setting it up so that multiple ETFs will start trading at the same time. Whatever the reason, they are invoking the marketing might of the biggest behemoths on Wall Street to start peddling these ETFs. Expect to see lots of advertising pushing various crypto products. If the SEC doesn't want Mr. and Mrs. Main St to invest their IRAs in crypto, the SEC chose exactly the wrong approach.\"Cami Russo, founder of The Defiant: \"It's great that an ETF makes holding Bitcoin easier for institutions, but ultimately we're packaging bitcoin in a fund, so that intermediaries can sell them to investors, when crypto should be about pushing investors in the opposite direction, and getting them comfortable with non custodial and permission-less solutions.\"Anil Lulla, CEO, Delphi Digital: \"Now the process will be straightforward to buy Bitcoin for retirement accounts with much lower fees. Today is the last day ever where the only people incentivized to shill $BTC and crypto are us in the community. Tomorrow, all these ETF issuers will have teams of people incentivized to call our parents/grandparents up to talk about Bitcoin. And the competition will be fierce. Especially in this first year, once a frontrunner is obvious, it will continue to get an outsized portion of inflows into these ETFs. Because of this, the fees will be a race to near zero. You've already seen this start to happen.\"Molly White, author of the Citation Needed newsletter: \"Even the bitcoin ETFs are approved and it fails to have significant price impact, I think we will still all be able to celebrate bitcoin achieving an important milestone towards its original goals. Finally, people will be able to turn their money into an anonymous peer-to peer asset outside of government control, to which they own their own keys and thus control completely, without having to involve powerful financial institutions like BlackRock.\"Cory Klippsten, CEO, Swan Bitcoin: \"The top-of-funnel for Bitcoin is now represented by the most established and trusted Wall Street institutions which will proceed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars extolling the virtues of Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin. Now that the primary entry points for Bitcoin exposure do not include appeals to gamble with hundreds of dubious crypto tokens, we just might see the end of massive crypto pump-and-dump cycles.\"Lex Sokolin, managing partner, Generative Ventures: \"I’m excited to see capital flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem at a time where more programmability and functionality is available. From payments companies building on top of Lightning to inscriptions allowing for tokenization of text and images, it’s exciting to see Bitcoin reflecting the broader potential pioneered by Web3.

The space is going to get a lot bigger, very quickly, more quickly than I think most people currently in the space are prepared for.\"Yiannis Giokas, senior director, Moody’s Analytics (risk and analytics arm): \"The SEC's approval of bitcoin spot ETFs marks a significant step towards the institutionalization of cryptocurrency, expanding bitcoin's accessibility to a wider audience in a more regulated and simpler manner. Such an ETF could lead to increased demand for bitcoin, and enhance both price discovery and market liquidity. However, this development also brings certain risks. The notorious price volatility of bitcoin, as well as its fluctuating values against stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, could expose mainstream investors to a less familiar spectrum of investment risks.\"Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity: \"We’ve long believed a spot-priced exchange traded-product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin. Fidelity has engaged in constructive dialogue with the SEC for years, and the affirmation of this approval signals positive momentum for the industry, and increased choice for investors who want to engage with digital assets. As a firm, we remain committed to meeting the growing demand from investors by providing them with tools that support their choices and facilitate secure access to markets.\"Andrew Rossow, attorney and CEO of AR Media: \"This level of confidence in a bitcoin ETF being approved isn’t something to take lightly, because of the high-level demand that the market has been begging for in establishing some initial regulatory framework with respect to digital assets and modern day securities law. The frustration with the SEC’s internal infrastructure and understanding of this emerging digital finance sector has only been met with short-sightedness, leaving not just the SEC on autopilot, but also leaves consumers, financial institutions and retail investors, and now regulators vulnerable to exploits that only serve to hinder market growth and cap the expansion rate with these emerging markets and technologies in our digital age.\"Whether SEC Chair Gary Gensler likes it or not, the system must change with respect to securities laws, because the domestic and international markets have changed (and are actively adapting). The SEC can no longer hide behind its fear of market manipulation, an irony in which the SEC has actually been manipulating the market by resisting natural progression. As we saw today, this market will always try to self-correct, even if it comes in the form of mundane black hat cyber attacks.\"Samuel Armes, founder, Florida Blockchain Association: \"I think at the end of the day, these ETFs are going to bring a bunch of money into the space. It's going to make the price go up. It's going to make more people involved. But, I also think it's going to start the division between actually being able to hold your keys and having, you know, synthetic bitcoin. So, I think most people will opt to just buy and hold the ETF. I think a lot of boomers in the older generation will never self custody their bitcoin, which is obviously antithetical to the mission of the token, but they just want to get involved in it now that bitcoin is back. So, the base layer mission of Bitcoin of sovereign independence and freedom money will take a hit. But, the price is still coming to work, and adoption — quote-on-quote — will go up as well, whatever that means.\"Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder, Anchorage Digital: \"A spot bitcoin ETF marks the end of crypto as a \"novel\" asset class — and the beginning of a world where it can be part of every portfolio. SEC approval opens the floodgates for trillions of dollars to safely flow into the digital asset ecosystem via a regulated and accessible wrapper that suits consumers and institutions of all types.\"Sheila Warren, CEO, Crypto Council for Innovation: \"A spot bitcoin ETF isn’t just a financial instrument. It’s a significant and practical move towards integrating crypto into the mainstream. This move helps make this revolutionary technology more accessible to all.Regulatory evolution: The introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF isn’t just about market dynamics, it’s a catalyst for regulatory evolution. It necessitates a framework that accommodates the unique nature of crypto, potentially leading to more appropriate and informed regulatory policies in the crypto space.Increased legitimacy: This milestone will shift public perception, painting bitcoin as a legitimate component of a diversified investment portfolioDemocratizing access: A spot bitcoin ETF is a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of crypto. Allowing investors to partake in the Bitcoin journey without the technical hurdles of direct ownership is a significant step towards inclusivity.Innovative financial landscapes: A spot bitcoin ETF is a precursor to a plethora of innovative financial products and services that straddle the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, expanding the horizon for what’s possible within the crypto ecosystemMarket dynamics: The ripple effects of a spot bitcoin ETF could lead to a recalibration of market dynamics, aligning them closer to traditional financial markets, yet retaining the distinct characteristics of the crypto world.\"Yoni Assia, CEO and Co-founder of eToro: “The term ‘watershed moment’ can be a cliche, but in the case of today’s bitcoin ETF news, it could not be more justified. For 15 years, bitcoin has been growing in prominence as an asset class amongst retail investors, while in a reversal of traditional roles, institutional investors have remained largely on the sidelines waiting for traditional finance rails to be put in place.“Today’s news provides an answer for institutional demand for bitcoin. It’s good news for crypto markets and supportive of our belief that bitcoin is an unstoppable technology. It is digital gold and taking a long term view, I believe that it represents the intersection of finance, economics and technology.“For our users, retail investors, today’s news is positive as it will be supportive of the growth of bitcoin as an asset class, but I believe that the majority of ordinary investors will want to continue to buy and hold real BTC.”See also: Gary Gensler's Statement on Bitcoin ETF ApprovalsTroy Cross professor of philosophy at Reed College and a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute: \"Larry Fink is Constantine, meaning the emperor who converts to Christianity, changing both the empire and the religion forever. You’ll find Christians who think that marked the victory of the church and others who think it ended true Christianity. Same for bitcoin. Bitcoin’s cultural identity, its symbology and associations, are going to change. And this is inevitable but also dangerous, given its cypherpunk roots and its potential as a tool of freedom. Let’s see if bitcoiners can educate about permissionlessness, censorship resistance and self-sovereignty when the attention is on NGU number go up and the narrative is dominated by trusted intermediaries.\"Charles d'Haussy, CEO, dYdX Foundation: \"The influx of new capital from institutional investors through Bitcoin Spot ETFs  will be amplified in derivative markets.

It’s a bold acknowledgement that crypto is here to stay. This would not have been possible without nearly a decade of work and commitment from countless people who believe in the future of our industry and see crypto as an integral part of the global financial ecosystem.

Absolutely. Is that same ETF also necessary for crypto to grow? Also yes.", "article body": "It’s the moment the crypto world has been waiting for: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally approved the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.Is this mainstream-friendly investment vehicle at odds with Bitcoin’s original goal of breaking away from Wall Street? Absolutely. Is that same ETF also necessary for crypto to grow? Also yes. The crypto industry has simply not been able to reach mainstream adoption on its own.That’s why, despite the obvious contradictions, much of the crypto community has been eagerly anticipating this ETF for years. The SEC turned down application after application, but recently the tide started to turn. We never know for sure what drives up the price of Bitcoin, but ETF euphoria has been a pretty good guess. Bitcoin rallied nearly 160% in 2023 and has gained 50% in the last six months alone, a surge widely acknowledged to be driven by ETF dreams.So let’s just take a moment to talk about the elephant in the room. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto created the world’s first major cryptocurrency specifically to decrease reliance on financial institutions. Bitcoin’s invention followed the 2008 financial crisis and the related collapse in trust in the banking system. The very first sentence of the Bitcoin white paper abstract envisions “a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”Read more: What Is a Bitcoin ETF? In other words, Bitcoin was designed to be everything an ETF is not.An ETF gives investors exposure to bitcoin in their traditional brokerage accounts via the stock market. The institutions applying for ETFs include Blackrock, Grayscale and Fidelity, the very “intermediaries” that Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to eliminate.Then there’s that favorite phrase of crypto purists, “not your keys, not your coins.” This basically means that if you are holding bitcoin on a crypto exchange as opposed to in your own wallet, for example, then that bitcoin is not truly yours. ETFs introduce yet another degree of separation. Investors in an ETF aren’t even buying actual bitcoin, they are just buying price exposure to that bitcoin.And finally, there was Nakamoto’s warning that “the cost of mediation increases transaction costs.” A Bitcoin ETF certainly doesn’t solve this problem. Instead, it comes with management fees, with Grayscale’s fees reaching up to 1.5%, even if competition is already driving some issuers' fees down.So why is the crypto world so excited about this Diet Coke version of digital currency? This is pretty far from the decentralized future that we’ve all been supposedly fighting for.The mostly simple answer, of course, is price. With some exceptions, much of the industry still remains highly vulnerable to the whims of token prices. When the markets are down, venture capitalists lose interest and sponsorships and advertising budgets suffer. Consumer-facing services find it harder to onboard new users. Furthermore, various altcoins tend to rise or sink with bitcoin. This time, bitcoin’s rise seems to be largely thanks to major financial institutions and the SEC. But the industry is not complaining about it too much.Then there is the whole mainstream adoption argument – namely that spot ETF approvals will unleash a flood of new investors who can’t be bothered to open an account at a crypto exchange, much less set up a wallet on their phone or run a node on their home computer. On a more basic level, involvement by brand-name institutions in the market may assuage investors who associate crypto with fraud. Thanks to ETFs, the crypto community has enjoyed a few weeks of relatively positive media attention, a nice break from all the Sam Bankman-Fried headlines of 2023.Read more: How to Buy a Bitcoin ETF (Assuming They Get Approved)What the ETF really brings is more credibility. In this case, Wall Street involvement is contingent on government approval. The SEC finally approving an ETF after years of rejections based on fears of “market manipulation” indicates a degree of acceptance, however begrudging, of this asset class by one of its fiercest critics, SEC chair Gary Gensler. In theory, crypto is also independent of governments, and so the SEC shouldn’t matter that much. In reality, crypto Twitter is basically obsessed with most everything Gensler says and does.That said, Gensler’s apparent antipathy to the industry, which manifests itself in a lack of regulatory clarity and a slew of lawsuits against major industry players, has not killed the industry. Nor has it stopped crypto from booming in other parts of the world, particularly in Asia. But it has come at a cost. Some crypto companies spend years embroiled in SEC lawsuits. Others choose to avoid the U.S. entirely, despite it being the world's largest economy and a major source of capital and talent.Crypto needs some degree of government approval. It needs Wall Street involvement. The future of crypto does not look like the Wild West, it looks more like Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, three jurisdictions with some of the toughest regulations in the world.It’s hard enough to build a decentralized project, let alone in a bear market with hostile regulators, cautious investors and wary consumers. Hopefully Wall Street’s culture will not define the industry, but will provide a stamp of credibility that allows more crypto projects to thrive.Edited by Marc Hochstein."},

It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.Monday’s market moves came as potential issuers ranging from BlackRock (BLK) to Grayscale filed their offering fees to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, marking one of the final steps before the first-ever bitcoin ETF can be floated in the U.S.Thirteen proposed ETFs are awaiting SEC approval, and the battle for customers is seemingly heating up already – some issuers are charging no fees for the first six months or $5 billion in assets under management (AUM).A final decision on the approvals, or denials, is expected on Wednesday.

The approved Bitcoin ETFs will be subject to ongoing surveillance and compliance measures to ensure continued investor protection.\"The tweet was quickly removed. SEC Chair Gary Gensler confirmed the message should not have gone out, and that no approval had been granted.While the incident certainly raises concerns over how the SEC secures its social media accounts as well as the protections needed to prevent market manipulation in the digital age, the biggest question raised by the bogus tweet is how the market will respond when a bitcoin ETF is ultimately approved.See also: Fake Bitcoin ETF Approval Tweet Causes $90M in LiquidationsWith this fake tweet, we got to see how the market could react, which was perhaps the point of the stunt.Bitcoin's price spiked to $47,900 immediately following the first tweet, and then dropped 1.5% to $46,247 after the news was debunked.There's a lot riding on these funds, and the market has spent months (if not years) awaiting the SEC's decision on a number of spot bitcoin ETF applications in the U.S. Although industry speculators are confident an exchange-traded fund will be approved, the SEC, known for its anti-crypto stance, may reject the applications once again after this incident. The commission is due to make a decision by Wednesday.Bitcoin has climbed 164% in the past year following the market crash beginning at the end of 2021, in large part driven by the growing hype around ETFs. While there are valid reasons to believe spot bitcoin ETFs will bring capital into the sector, many speculate the moment of approval will be a \"sell the news\" event.See also: Bitcoin ETFs: The Bull CaseSpot bitcoin ETFs are a way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movements, without having to directly buy the cryptocurrency. There are currently 13 live applications in the U.S., including from Wall Street titans including BlackRock, VanEck and Fidelity as well as a number of crypto-native companies. The funds will own the actual bitcoin, and issue shares that track the price of the coins — much like any other ETF, which can track commodities, equities and/or indexes.If approved, spot ETFs will make it easier for a wider range of investors to speculate on bitcoin, including large companies that want to build build BTC's volatility into their portfolios. In other words, these funds could bring crypto mainstream, hence the anticipation and trading ahead of the SEC's approval or rejection.The SEC, in general, has taken a hard line against crypto, though its recent legal defeat against, Grayscale, which has applied to convert its massive GBTC trust into an ETF structure, has strongly raised the industry's hopes that such a product will be approved.If the agency gives the green light, the next question will be how much capital ETFs will attract in the first days and coming years. It also remains to be seen how long speculation around spot ETFs will continue.Security concernsThere's a certain irony to the fake bitcoin ETF announcement moving the market in that the main reason the SEC has been resistant to approve a bitcoin ETF is because of the potential for market manipulation. Following an investigation, X said the SEC account was hijacked \"due to an unidentified individual obtaining control over a phone number associated with the @SECGov account through a third party.\"This sounds like the number linked to the account got SIM-swapped. We're also told that two-factor authentication was not enabled.While this hack is not exactly the type of thing the SEC likely had in mind when raising concerns to the ETF applicants, SIM swapping is a common occurrence in crypto. In fact, it's one of the most common ways for people to lose their crypto.

GBTC’s discount to NAV began to narrow significantly as the expectations of an ETF approval surfaced last summer and also on rising bitcoin sentiment.Prior to the SEC’s approval to convert the fund into an ETF, the discount had fallen to as low as 5.6% on Monday.“GBTC converging to NAV is a huge relief for the space and a symbol of the industry's move into a new stage of maturation,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat.“This product GBTC caused a lot of unnecessary pain over the past few years for obvious reasons,” said Farrell.Fund StructureThe reason behind the discount was due to the nature of the fund. GBTC acted similar to a closed-end fund, which meant it lacked the inherent arbitrage mechanism that enables market makers to create or redeem shares at their discretion.“The bitcoin always existed in the trust but the lack of a redemption mechanism led to the massive discount to the underlying asset value,” explained Farrell. “Most importantly this hurt a lot of individual investors as they underperformed the benchmark but also led to massive credit blowups since the product was used as collateral throughout the space.”Previously, liquidity was only available over-the-counter in the secondary market, but now that the fund has been converted to an ETF, Authorized Participants are able to create and redeem ETF shares at NAV, tethering the market price of the ETF to its NAV, said Matt Kunke, crypto research analyst at GSR, in an interview with CoinDesk.“As a result, the premium/discount will likely only vary by a few basis points from par moving forward,” added Kunke.Looking forward, Farrell noted that it will be interesting to see how the discounts to NAV on Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) performs now that the probability of an eventual spot ether ETF approval has risen.“Chances are the discount closes quickly,” said Farrell.Edited by Nikhilesh De."},

Read on to learn what zero-knowledge proofs are, how they work, and why we need them in Web3.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are protocols that help prove the validity of statements on blockchains without offering information that may compromise privacy. They allow users to verify the validity of a transaction without revealing details of the transaction.In Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the prover is responsible for proving the claim, and the verifier’s role is to validate it. The protocols reveal on-chain that the hidden information is valid, and the prover knows this with high certainty.In the hands of malicious actors, personally identifiable information (PII) can present certain risks, such as identity theft, reputational damage, and discrimination. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure your PII remains protected.Consider a scenario where you must prove your identity to complete a transaction. You will need to provide evidence such as your driver’s license and other PII.However, you will have no control over the safety of that information once it’s in the hands of a third party. Hackers could target the third party’s central database, or the third party could share your information with others for targeted advertising purposes and other reasons.With zero-knowledge proofs, you can avoid sharing this information and stick to proving its validity.How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?Zero-knowledge proofs utilize algorithms that process input data and confirm its truthfulness. Projects like StarkNet on Ethereum, Polygon Zero, Zk Sync, and more are currently using the protocols in their functionality.For zero-knowledge proofs to work efficiently, there are three criteria they need to satisfy:Zero-knowledge: The verifier cannot access the original input. The only information available to them is the statement’s validity.Soundness: The protocol cannot validate invalid input as being true. The protocol must have safeguards to ensure the prover has no room to manipulate the verifier into thinking their statement is true.Completeness: Provided the input is valid, the protocol always validates the statement. The protocol accepts the proof if both parties act honestly and the underlying information is true.A basic zero-knowledge proof comprises three elements.First, we have the witness, which is the secret information. The prover provides questions that only a party privy to the information would know.The second element is the challenge, where the verifier selects a question from the set for the prover to answer.The third and final element is the response, where the prover answers the question. With the response, the verifier confirms that the prover can access the witness. The verifier then proceeds to select more questions from the set. The multiple questions limit the possibility of the prover faking knowledge of the information.Types of Zero-Knowledge ProofsThere are two types of zero-knowledge proofs: interactive and non-interactive.Interactive zero-knowledge proofs allow back-and-forth communication between two parties. The communication allows statement validity verification to the verifier’s satisfaction.Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs: Here, two parties engage in only one communication round. The prover shares the information with an algorithm that computes zero-knowledge proof. The verifier receives the proof and uses another algorithm to confirm the prover’s knowledge.Given the convenience of non-interactive ZKPs, many currently available protocols fall under the non-interactive ZKPs category. Let’s look at some of them.ZK-SNARKs: Known in full as Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, their small size makes the verification process easy. These protocols utilize elliptical curves to generate a cryptographic proof, a process considered to be gas efficient.ZK-STARKs: They are known as Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge. They are fast due to the minimal interaction between two parties.Bulletproofs: These do not require a trusted setup. The short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs enable private cryptocurrency transactions.PLONK: These are known as Permutations over Lagrange bases for Oecumenical Non-interactive arguments of Knowledge. PLONKs allow a large number of participants by using a universal trusted setup.Why Do We Need Zero-Knowledge Proofs?Various use cases explain why we need zero-knowledge proofs. Let’s take a look at some of the most important.Security and privacy: The pseudonymity of Web3 fails to guarantee complete privacy since the transaction history is available on public blockchains. With ZKPs, information verification is possible without revealing PII, thus maintaining anonymity.Identity verification: Proving one’s identity does not have to include sharing sensitive information. ZKPs offer an avenue to carry out the identity verification process privately and securely.Scalability: With ZKPs, blockchain networks can verify transactions without revealing the underlying data. The network’s efficiency improves since the information stored on the blockchain reduces significantly.Compliance: Organizations can comply with regulatory requirements regarding money laundering, KYC, and other relevant laws. ZKPs allow organizations to comply without storing users’ personal information on centralized databases.Zero-knowledge proofs are a fundamental cryptography tool offering information authentication to unidentified or untrusted parties. The pseudonymous nature of the Web3 space presents a challenge in matters of information verification. ZKPs address this pain point through revolutionary protocols that promise to ensure fast and secure transactions."},

This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.What’s more, it has done so with no corporation or government entity behind it, no VC money for its operations, no internal PR team. Bitcoin’s community is perhaps not so quiet, but the protocol itself has been remarkably lacking in drama. Running quietly in the background, the asset the network generates has found its way into institutional portfolios and retail holdings around the world, regardless of national boundaries and regulations.An asset without jurisdiction, without controller, without issuer other than a strip of code is now accepted in the highest echelons of finance, by the largest fund managers in the largest financial market in the world.In just 15 years. That is an astonishing progression.But yesterday was more than a milestone for Bitcoin. It was a big step for Wall Street as well.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Approval: Full CoverageBitcoin doesn’t need Wall Street. Sure, the money doesn’t hurt, but Bitcoin would work just fine without institutional interest.It’s Wall Street that wants Bitcoin. It doesn’t need Bitcoin, but it wants it. Mainstream validation doesn’t get louder than this.Many other “alternative” assets without issuer or jurisdiction are also supported by Wall Street. Gold, for instance, was once regarded as a niche investment for “gold bugs” who were generally regarded as being on the fringes of finance (sound familiar?). But, by the time Wall Street figured out how to package exposure to gold to meet investor demand for convenience, gold had been around for millennia. Bitcoin is barely 15 years old.Yesterday was a big win for Bitcoin. It was a big win for Wall StreetAnd gold is a natural element, produced by the galactic forces that made the planet we live on. There’s not much due diligence to perform there.Bitcoin was created by one or more human beings, and yet due diligence other than code revision is not possible since we don’t know who he, she or they are. Never before has Wall Street embraced a man-made asset without putting the creators through intense scrutiny.Read more: Bitcoin ETFs Approved: The Industry ReactsThat makes yesterday a big day not just for Bitcoin, but also for Wall Street. Trusted financial names with considerable clout have invested resources and reputation in presenting a “rebel” asset to their mainstream client base. They have done so voluntarily, despite regulatory pressure to stay away, because they have done independent research and understood that Bitcoin offers a unique diversification opportunity for their clients.This validation occurred outside the halls of official power. It occurred in the boardrooms of finance. In a way, Bitcoin has returned power to Wall Street, reaffirming the prerogative of businesses to satisfy client demand, and the right of investors to choose what to do with their money.Bitcoin helped Wall Street win a battle against limitations on opportunity due to illogical regulatory prejudices. And Wall Street showed that it is not as rigid in its financial thinking as most assume.Yesterday was a big win for Bitcoin. It was a big win for Wall Street. Perhaps even more important, beyond those two milestones in image transformation, it was a big win for investors.Edited by Benjamin Schiller."},

A Brief Guide to CBDCs", "article subtitle": "Central bank digital currency (CBDC) aims to take the benefits from blockchain-based digital currency and combine it with fiat currency under the control of the central bank.", "article body": "With cryptocurrencies exposing the inefficiencies of traditional payment systems, central banks have started exploring the concept of central bank-issued digital currencies.Read on as we discuss how CBDCs differ from cryptocurrencies, their opportunities and risks, and the controversy behind them.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency?A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a blockchain-based digital form of fiat currency issued and managed by a central bank.As CBDCs are essentially a blockchain-powered version of a country’s national currency, CBDCs are automatically considered legal tend and can be used for payments. The primary idea behind CBDCs is to offer a government-sanctioned digital payment system that addresses payment inefficiencies within a country.How Is CBDC Different Than Cryptocurrency?CBDCs only draw inspiration from cryptocurrencies, but they are significantly different from them. Cryptocurrencies’ key feature is the decentralized aspect. Decentralized digital currencies such as Bitcoin are borderless, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. Peer-to-peer transactions take place on public blockchains, and no one can tell a user what they can or can’t do with their digital money.For CBDCs, the central bank controls the digital currency and oversees transactions, potentially allowing it to take actions such as freezing funds, blacklisting digital wallet addresses, and directly incentivizing individuals to spend their money (as opposed to saving it), especially if the CBDC is programmable.Given that most CBDCs are in the conceptual stages, we’ll have to wait and see how they will actually operate (especially beyond national borders), and the level of control central banks will have.Types of CBDCsThere are two main types of CBDCs: wholesale and retail.The classification depends on the intended users: one is for financial institutions, and the other is for the general public.Wholesale CBDCs target financial institutions, which can utilize them for inter-bank transactions.The intended users of retail CBDCs are the public for everyday transactions, such as buying goods and services and sending money. Ideally, retail CBDCs will complement traditional bank accounts and cash. However, it is still too early in the concept and implementation stage to determine the impact on traditional financial systems.Opportunities & Risks of CBDCsCBDCs can potentially change the financial landscape. However, it’s still early to tell whether the net change will be positive or negative for society. Here’s a look at the opportunities and risks they offer.ProsThird-Party Risk Elimination: The system relies on the central bank’s stability, unlike in traditional finance, where commercial banks are the counterparties.Cost Reduction: Central banks will deal directly with the public, removing the current expensive banking infrastructure. This has the potential to drive down transaction costs.Financial Inclusivity: CBDCs could potentially present a financial structure that eases access to financial services.ConsComplete Lack of Privacy: CBDCs will require a healthy dose of personal information. The issuing central banks are responsible for fraud monitoring and ascertaining the legality of transactions. The government would have access to financial information without going through third parties to access it.Government Control of Consumer Behavior: CBDCs run the risk of being tools the government uses to encourage certain practices in line with its policies. For example, a government could program its CBDC only to be used to purchase certain goods and services but not others.Centralization Risk: With CBDCs, central banks would likely be the sole entirety in control of the digital currency, creating a single point of failure hackers could exploit, which could have crippling effects on the economy if a hack occurs.Why Are CBDCs Considered Controversial?A key issue with traditional finance is the control third parties like banks have over transactions. CBDCs would take further control and give the government direct access to everyone’s financial information.Moreover, if a CBDC is programmable, it would allow the government to actively incentivize or disincentivize certain behaviors by its population. For example, it could directly prevent citizens from purchasing things like alcohol or cigarettes, if the government would want to actively discourage consumption. Clearly, there is potential for abuse of such access and control.In a world where people decry the lack of privacy from government intrusion and surveillance, CBDCs would only serve to compound the problem."},

Bitcoin futures ETFs have traded on U.S. exchanges for several years. Spot bitcoin ETFs were finally approved on Jan. 10, 2024, and began trading the next day.In this guide, you will learn about bitcoin ETFs, how they work and which ones you can already can invest in.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What is a bitcoin ETF?Bitcoin ETFs are publicly traded investment funds that enable investors to gain exposure to bitcoin (BTC) without actually owning the cryptocurrency. Unlike cryptocurrencies that are traded on crypto exchanges, ETFs are traded on traditional securities exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.When you invest in a bitcoin ETF, you’re not directly purchasing bitcoin itself. Instead, you’re buying shares in a fund that holds bitcoin. This regulated investment vehicle is designed to make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements without having to securely buy and store the digital currency, alleviating the technological hurdles of investing in crypto.How do bitcoin ETFs work?Bitcoin ETFs function in a way similar to the traditional exchange-traded funds you might be familiar with. An ETF issuer, typically an asset management company, purchases the underlying asset and securely stores it with a custodian. Then, it issues shares to its fund to provide investors with access to the underlying asset held in the fund.In exchange for an annual fund management fee, the financial institution manages the purchasing, storing, and safekeeping of bitcoin on behalf of the ETF’s investors.When investing in a bitcoin ETF, you’re essentially buying shares in a pool of bitcoin. This process involves the creation of new ETF shares to match the demand. Conversely, when you sell your shares, they are redeemed, effectively adjusting the total number of ETF shares in circulation.ETF shares and bitcoin pricesThe value of a bitcoin ETF's shares reflects the performance of bitcoin. As the price of bitcoin moves, the value of the ETF shares adjusts accordingly.To ensure that the ETF shares stay in sync with bitcoin prices, market makers actively buy and sell, maintaining a balance between supply and demand. If the ETF’s price starts deviating from the actual bitcoin price, market makers step in to restore equilibrium – earning a profit in the process.Why is a spot bitcoin ETF considered such a big deal?The introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF is considered a significant development in the cryptocurrency space for several reasons:Mainstream adoption: A spot bitcoin ETF should attract a broader range of investors, including institutional investors, who have been hesitant to invest directly in the cryptocurrency markets for regulatory reasons. This could lead to increased adoption of bitcoin as an investment asset.Regulatory approval: The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs required regulatory approval from the SEC, which could provide an additional level of legitimacy and oversight to the cryptocurrency markets. This could pave the way for more regulatory clarity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies.Convenience and accessibility: A spot bitcoin ETF makes it easier for retail investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without the technical challenges of wallet management and private key security. It offers a more user-friendly and familiar investment vehicle.Market maturity: The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs could signify that the cryptocurrency market has matured to a point where it can support regulated and standardized investment products. This could attract more institutional capital and increase market stability.While bitcoin futures ETFs have been available for some time, the introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF holds the promise of further mainstream adoption, regulatory clarity and market maturity for bitcoin as an asset class.What’s the difference between a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF?The primary distinction between a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF lies in the underlying assets they invest in.A bitcoin futures ETF invests in futures contracts that derive their value from the expected future price of bitcoin. These contracts enable investors to speculate on bitcoin’s price movements without holding the actual cryptocurrency.A spot bitcoin ETF invests directly in bitcoin itself. Investors in a spot Bitcoin ETF own a share of the actual cryptocurrency, and the ETF’s value is directly correlated with the price of bitcoin in the market."},

Others promise extremely high yields or offer exclusive digital goods, as seen in NFT rug pulls.Crypto rug pulls can also occur when the project’s owners manipulate the value of a particular token or coin to deceive investors and subsequently siphon off their investments.Fraudsters often attract victims with a sudden, sharp increase in the token’s value in a short period. Once the price peaks, the people behind the token sell it to generate a profit while leaving “investors” with steep losses.Rug pulls often occur on decentralized trading platforms, enabling the fraudster to benefit from the pseudonymity of DEXes.Types of Rug PullsRug pulls can generally be categorized into hard and soft rug pulls.Hard rug pulls are more acute and sudden. Investors can lose all their funds within a short time. Soft rug pulls happen over a longer period. The core development team gives investors a false sense of security while they quietly shut down.Common types of rug pulls include:Liquidity Pulls: Malicious actors remove liquidity from a token pool, causing the token’s value to plummet due to a lack of buyers and sellers.Fake Projects: Scammers create seemingly legitimate projects, gather investments, and then disappear with the funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens.Pump and Dump: Fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a token through coordinated buying, only to sell their holdings at the peak and crash the value.Team Exit: The project’s team members suddenly disappear or exit, leaving investors with no support and a collapsing token.How To Identify & Avoid Rug PullsIdentifying and avoiding rug pulls requires a combination of diligence and caution. Here’s how you can protect yourself:Thorough research: Investigate the project’s team, technology, goals, and community before investing. Look for red flags such as unknown teams or lack of transparency.Security audits: Reputable projects often undergo third-party security audits. Check if the project has been audited and review the audit report for vulnerabilities.Community engagement: Engage with the project’s community on social media and forums. A strong and active community can indicate a legitimate project.Warning signs: Be cautious of unrealistic returns and yields, excessive marketing, and pressure to invest quickly. Trust your instincts and avoid FOMO.Finally, always ensure you only invest money you can afford to lose. Many cryptocurrency projects are experimental, and sometimes the failure of an idea can lead to the team doing a soft rug pull, which means they quietly stop supporting the project.5 Biggest Crypto Rug Pulls in HistoryWhile crypto rug pulls have always been a spectacle in the industry, some scams left a mark in the industry.Here’s a look at five of history’s biggest crypto rug pulls.OneCoinOneCoin was a cryptocurrency-based Ponzi scheme promoted as a new digital currency that would revolutionize the financial world. The scheme was run by Ruja Ignatova, who claimed that OneCoin was backed by a team of experts and had a vast network of distributors.However, OneCoin was never actually backed by anything, and the distributors were simply paid to recruit new investors. When the scheme eventually collapsed, investors lost over $4 billion.ThodexThodex was a Turkish cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked in 2021. The hacker stole over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency from Thodex users, and the exchange’s founder, Faruk Özer, then disappeared. Özer was later arrested in Albania in 2022.AnubisDAOAnubisDAO was a DeFi project launched in 2021. The project promised high returns to investors, but it was a rug pull. The developers drained the project’s liquidity pool and disappeared, leaving investors with nothing.Uranium FinanceUranium Finance was a DeFi project that promised to provide investors with exposure to uranium mining, but it was yet another rug pull. The developers of Uranium Finance drained the project’s liquidity pool and vanished, leaving token holders with heavy losses.Squid Game TokenSquid Game Token was a scam cryptocurrency created in 2021, inspired by the popular Netflix series “Squid Game.”  However, the token was a rug pull. The developers disabled the token’s ability to be sold, and then disappeared with investors’ money.Crypto rug pulls remain a significant threat in the crypto space, preying on unsuspecting investors and causing substantial financial losses.By understanding the various types of rug pulls, learning how to identify early warning signs, and implementing best practices for investing, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to these malicious schemes."},

A Beginner’s Guide", "article subtitle": "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) bitcoin in an automated manner has emerged as a popular way to “stack sats” among Bitcoiners.  ", "article body": "Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin has become an incredibly popular way to invest in the world’s leading digital currency. Read on to learn about Bitcoin DCA, how it works, and why it has become popular among investors.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What Is Bitcoin Dollar-Cost Averaging?Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin, also called Bitcoin DCA, is an investment strategy where you buy a fixed amount of BTC at regular intervals, no matter the price.You can set up a specific amount of money to invest periodically, such as weekly or monthly, and stick to this schedule over time. This means you reduce the impact of short-term market volatility, as the specified amount buys more BTC when prices are low and less when prices are high, ultimately averaging out the cost per BTC. Hence, the term cost-averaging.The result is a disciplined and low-stress investment approach. By removing the need to make decisions based on short-term price movements (i.e., trying to time the market), you can alleviate emotional reactions to market movements while growing your bitcoin investment over time.How Does Bitcoin DCA Work?Now, let’s take a look at how you can dollar-cost average bitcoin. Here’s how it works.Set a budget: First, figure out how much you’re comfortable investing regularly. Some bitcoin savings apps allow you to start with as little as $10, but it’s entirely up to you how much you want to invest in the digital currency every week or month.Decide on the intervals: It could be every week, bi-weekly, or once a month. Again, it’s totally up to you.Find a good platform: You need a place to buy your BTC. So, find a reputable bitcoin exchange or app that allows you to automatically save in bitcoin using recurring payments. Examples of popular Bitcoin DCA apps include Swan (US), Relai (Europe), and Bitnob (Africa).Start stacking sats:  Once you have registered for a Bitcoin DCA platform, set up regular bank transfers, and the app purchases bitcoin for you automatically at regular intervals based on the predetermined settings you have decided.Keep calm, stack, and HODL: As your Bitcoin savings app regularly buys bitcoin for you, make sure the bitcoin wallet you use is a secure, non-custodial wallet (a wallet where only you have access to the private keys) to ensure you can “HODL” your bitcoin investment safely for the long-term.Why Is “Stacking Sats” With Bitcoin DCA So Popular?Stacking sats is Bitcoin community jargon that refers to buying small amounts of bitcoin. Sats is short for satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin. One satoshi is one hundred millionth of one bitcoin.Anyone can do it: Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. You don’t need extensive financial or cryptocurrency expertise to get started.No need to attempt to time the market: Trying to buy (or sell) just at the right time is almost impossible. That is the case for professionals and as well newcomers. So instead of obsessing over bitcoin price charts, auto-saving in bitcoin using dollar-cost averaging alleviates the headache and stress of figuring out the right time to buy.Stay cool, emotionally: By automatically saving in bitcoin, you can prevent yourself from panic buying or panic selling due to market volatility. If regularly investing in bitcoin for the long term is part of your investment strategy, then you can set it and forget it and don’t need to check the price of bitcoin every day.Start small, dream big: Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging allows you to build your bitcoin investment over time, even if you only have a small amount of money available to invest. If you continue to stack sats for several years, your small weekly or monthly bitcoin purchases can grow into sizable bitcoin savings.Bitcoin DCA is an easy and simple way to invest in BTC without stressing over short-term price movements. Moreover, it allows anyone (even those with small investment capital) to start investing in the world’s leading digital asset.But remember, investing in BTC has its risks, and you shouldn’t invest all your savings. Having said that, with a long-term investment horizon in mind, Bitcoin DCA could turn out to be a wise way to invest in bitcoin."},

It's within this framework that the Algorand Foundation has created a team dedicated to impact and inclusion, investing and supporting those who also believe in the use of blockchain technology for a more just and equitable future.Following the Algorand Impact Summit, a two-day event bringing together developers, founders, executives, policymakers, NGOs, investors and other thought leaders who see blockchain as part of the solution to the world’s most intractable challenges, the CoinDesk team got to speak with the Algorand Foundation’s Matthew Keller to dive deeper into its impact initiatives.Matthew Keller is the director of impact and inclusion at the Algorand Foundation, where he is responsible for supporting and empowering individuals and institutions making use of the Algorand blockchain for social impact. Prior to joining the Algorand Foundation, Keller worked for a wide range of impact roles for global nonprofits and advocacy groups, such as the UN World Food Programme, One Laptop Per Child and XPRIZE.The following is our conversation on the impact of blockchain technology, how to measure success for inclusionary initiatives and how the Algorand Foundation thinks about the future of on-chain public goods.Matt, thank you for joining us. I’d like to hear more about your background leading into your time with the Algorand Foundation and what you’re working on today.The first half of my career I spent in politics with a good 12 years on Capitol Hill, both as a Senate staffer and then as the legislative director for a large public-interest organization called Common Cause. At Common Cause, I lobbied Congress on campaign finance reform issues regarding money in the American political process. I spent seven years working closely with our Senate champions John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI). After that bill was signed into law, I took a left turn, in a sense, and went to the United Nations World Food Programme in Rome, where I was both legal counsel and an advocate around issues of child hunger for five years as an international UN employee. It was during my time there that I fell in love with technology and learning.That interest in technology and learning led me to a project of the MIT Media Lab called One Laptop Per Child, which was a cutting edge project at the time. The question we were answering was: Can you get sophisticated technology into the hands of children living in some of the most remote places on Earth as a way to promote education? The project was popularly called “The $100 Laptop,” and I think we broke down some serious barriers at the time. From there, I led a project called The Global Learning XPRIZE, which was a $15 million competition sponsored by Elon Musk that proved the efficacy of dynamic and intuitive software for self-learning in reading, writing and math among some of the most marginalized children on Earth. I spent six years working in Tanzania and in the U.S. putting that together.And now I'm here at the Algorand Foundation. The task laid out for me was simple. Algorand is the most performative, secure and reliable blockchain technology out there. Its instant finality, high throughput, quantum security and negligible fees and environmental footprint allow it to scale. My job is to find and nurture those projects that can best take advantage of this technology and its ability to scale as a way to bring about transformative social and environmental impact.Of all the areas the Algorand Foundation focuses on in terms of impact, identity seems to stand out as one that seems to tie back into all the others. I would love to dive deeper into how you view blockchain-based identity and where it's heading.It's fundamental to everything. It's the thing that, without it, nothing else can really happen.Look, for example, at a place like Democratic Republic of Congo, where somewhere between 25% to 35% of kids are born without identity. What does that mean? It means that a sizable portion of the population are unlikely to be able to go to school, or access any kind of banking or financial services. They're unlikely to be recognized or counted as a citizen of that region, which then affects how government aid is spent.Identity is foundational to everything that you and I take for granted. And so digital identity is crucial for a significant number of people around the world who can then take that identity and use it across multiple platforms with multiple government groups or agencies. And it's on the blockchain, so it's irrefutable, immutable and transparent.Equal to this need for identity is that of education; we can’t implement these things without having those involved understanding how they are used. Is there an educational piece to your efforts as well?One of the things that we try to do is to show that the underlying technology, which is blockchain, is different from all the crypto headlines you read. We educate folks on why this matters and why it's important through proving its effectiveness.This is why a big part of our education effort at Algorand, is the demonstration of real-world cases by people who often live in the margins to prove the efficacy and the value of blockchain technology.We also recently announced a partnership with the UNDP [United Nations Development Program] to offer a blockchain curriculum to their 22,000 staff. By educating a big agency like that, the knock-on effects are pretty significant, because UNDP has excellent relationships with governments in the 180 countries in which they operate. And if they in turn educate those government officials, then you have real learning at scale among policymakers worldwide.Do you see a willingness to learn about these new technologies from groups like the UNDP and other national organizations?Yeah, 100%. In fact, I recently gave a talk in the U.S. Senate that was put on by the Global Blockchain Business Council. And there were a lot of staffers there from many different Hill offices and agencies. Everybody was curious and wanted to know: What can this be used for? Homeland Security, for example, was there to understand how they can use blockchain for identification and how to use blockchain to reach people who are being affected by disasters.I was on a call recently with the head of UNDP in Syria where the UN was trying to figure out how to get payments into the hands of people, without doing these big events where they hand out cash, which is ripe for violence, corruption and misuse.And those are just two events that have happened in the last few weeks. There's an eagerness to learn, which is exciting for us, and a realization that this potential is far greater than what people know. It's going to take time, but the appetite to learn is there for sure.I believe that having those educated conversations are going to lead to educated solutions. But you probably have a better idea of what these solutions look like in practice. Let’s use disaster relief as an example: Is there a clear path to how this could be solved? And how do you see blockchains impacting the future of disaster relief across the world?Yeah, it's the future. Whether or not the future happens faster or slower is a different question. If you look at what disaster relief looks like today, big agencies are still using Excel spreadsheets and paper-based solutions, as are most other agencies that work in disaster relief around the world.We just had an Impact Summit in India where I moderated a panel on disaster relief with speakers from the U.S. and India, and their problems were identical. The way they do it is antiquated, and the response time is between nine and 18 months for people to get the relief they need. You would not believe how ancient it feels.There’s no doubt that blockchain can help correct these issues. This is one of the places where I'm pretty certain that blockchain is going to revolutionize the way people receive assistance in emergencies, partly because a key to this will be digital, decentralized identities. These identities will be owned by the survivor, who can then use that identity to seek assistance for multiple disasters across multiple agencies, and which also allows for those agencies to ensure that person is not abusing the system. We’ll be looking at this closely in 2024 as several agencies in the U.S. will begin to provide relief to designated families through something we have invested in called the Kare Survivor Wallet.And another area for disruption is supply chain. There's no question in my mind that blockchain will be the foundation for most supply chains in the world.Yeah, let's jump into supply chain and supply chain transparency. I'm curious to see how Algorand is positioning itself to solve these problems that you seem pretty bullish on.I'm especially bullish because of the transparency and traceability of blockchain. One of the notable companies building on Algorand is WholeChain, which was created to bring visibility to fragmented supply chains and is partnering with some of the biggest companies in the world to do so. More and more people want to know where their product is coming from, and more and more regulators are demanding it.Because blockchain provides transparency and traceability, the ability to track a product back to its source, through the entire supply chain, is transformative. It’s a game changer.For example, some problems I witnessed while at the UN World Food Programme were proving that smallholder farmers are the ones that actually produce these products and ensuring that the recipient of the product is actually getting the product that was paid for. Blockchain solves a lot of these problems.What does the future of the world look like with these impact initiatives being implemented on the blockchain? How is this future different from one where we continue to use the traditional systems?I'll give you one example, you know, in probably the most difficult country in the world to work in, which is Afghanistan. And in Afghanistan, you've got 97% unemployment. You've got millions who run the brink of real hunger. It's a mess. It's an absolute mess.We have supported a payments platform called HesabPay with a substantial investment, which is a payments platform that allows organizations to provide aid to beneficiaries in Afghanistan. Through HesabPay, the UN can provide resources to people who are unemployed and in dire need of support.Those payments are instantaneous, and not only get into the hands of vulnerable people in a safe way, but they're also traceable. So the agency that actually gives the money knows that the money is not being misused by government officials, or being intercepted by middlemen.So those two pieces – instantaneous receipt which is safe and effective and traceability/trackability, which precludes the possibility of corruption – are transformational from my vantage point. Going forward, cash-based assistance within multilateral institutions will be moving toward blockchain solutions in the next few years.How do you measure success for impact initiatives? What does success look like for the Foundation and for those supported by your efforts?Yeah, it's a good question. I think it's about use and access. More access for previously marginalized individuals to a multitude of the services. Whether it's low fees when it comes to remittances, or in Afghanistan, for example, can more women get direct benefits more efficiently, quickly and safely by using a platform built on Algorand? In that particular case, a randomized control trial done by the London School of Economics answered with a resounding yes.So there are concrete outcomes that we look for. And a primary one is access in a more effective way that provides direct benefits to marginalized individuals, particularly in distressed areas. And these goals can be quantified.Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to share with our audience?At our Impact Summit in India, we highlighted all the work being done on the Algorand blockchain for impact, whether it's financial inclusion, environmental sustainability or impact more broadly. And when you bring all those people together, you see that there's something happening that is pretty profound in terms of how we're going to move forward to support the most marginalized populations in the world. I mean, in India alone, the projects that are underway – or about to get underway – are game changing. It is extraordinary to see all these young entrepreneurs who are daring enough to believe they can make a difference. And the use of this technology, particularly when it's in the hands of people building for impact, is really inspiring. When looking at the people we invest in, we partner with, we support, I just see nothing but hope. The ideas that come out of these people are so fascinating and groundbreaking that, if that's the future, I'm pretty happy with it.—For more on the Algorand Foundation’s commitment to impact and inclusion and the latest initiatives from Matthew Keller, check out the Algorand Foundation’s Impact page and a recap of the recent Algorand Impact Summit."},

", "article body": "As if the egg on his face wasn’t enough, Gary Gensler also has sour grapes. An hour after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency he leads, approved just under a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs, Gensler issued a statement making absolutely clear the move is absolutely not an endorsement of bitcoin (BTC).This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Unmute“Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,” is how he chose to end his personal statement. This is nothing new for the top securities cop in the U.S. Gensler has said time and again that cryptocurrencies have failed to demonstrate societal value.Nevermind that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reignited interest in bitcoin last year, during the depths of the bear market, when it applied to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the obvious consumer demand for such a product. Soon after, the SEC was fielding at least 12 other ETF applications, and BTC’s price was rallying.Perhaps worse for Gensler, the demand is real: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is on track to notch a historic $3 billion in capital inflows on its first day of trading, to say nothing of its competitors. The sheer number of thematic crypto funds launched this week is also unprecedented, showing the high level of interest by financial service providers.As Georgetown professor James Angel told CoinDesk over email, the SEC, by denying them for so long, may itself have had a hand in stirring demand for bitcoin ETFs. Gensler noted, until Wednesday, the agency had denied at least 20 such applications, which indirectly acted as free marketing.In his letter, Gensler suggests he likely would have preferred that the current cast of bitcoin ETFs didn’t come to market at all. But his hand was forced after an appeals court in Washington D.C. reprimanded his agency’s “arbitrary and capricious” logic for denying Grayscale’s plans to convert the GBTC trust into an ETF.See also: Bitcoin ETFs Approved: The Industry ReactsGensler doesn’t sound particularly gracious when telling the story, saying that only after the SEC ran out of options to reject more spot bitcoin ETF applications did it become clear that “the most sustainable path forward” was to finally approve them.Although the agency has had a few high-profile settlements with crypto promoters, when cases actually go to court, it hasn’t really worked out in its favor (see: SEC v. Ripple). None of this bodes well for the SEC in the legal fights it is picking with fighters like Coinbase and Kraken, in which the SEC has made bold, unproven claims about securities law and crypto.Moreover, Gensler doesn’t sound particularly “merit neutral” (which is how the SEC describes its role in regulating markets) when drawing a comparison between bitcoin and gold, saying one is a commodity with industrial and consumer use and the other is primarily used for ransomware, money laundering, sanctions-evasion and terrorist financing, when not for pure speculation.There’s something like $16 trillion worth of capital in gold ETFs today, an indication that gold might just be a tool for speculation, too. Putting all that aside, in recent months the SEC has gone to lengths to point out the cybersecurity risks around cryptocurrencies, which seems part and parcel of its broader push to strengthen corporate security protocols.The Financial Times reported: Gensler has made “security a pillar of his agenda, adopting tougher rules to broaden disclosures of businesses’ cyber incidents and punishing companies for misleading investors about their cyber security practices.” The agency has even posted PSAs on social media about best practices for password protection.All of which makes the agency’s own “security incident” on Tuesday – when an unknown actor “breached” the SEC’s Twitter/X account to post about bitcoin ETFs – all the more embarrassing. According to an investigation X’s “Safety” team, the SEC did not have two-factor protections turned on. So much for Gensler’s public service announcements.It was such a bizarre incident that I’m wondering if it was an inside job, perhaps Gary’s last ditch effort to prove that bitcoin markets could be manipulated so that he again could delay the inevitable. (Bitcoin ETFs were often denied due to market manipulation concerns).See also: Bitcoin ETFs: The Bull CaseOnly that, because bitcoin is considered a commodity, the hack might be investigated by the SEC’s sister agency/rival, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which would be an extreme embarrassment for Gensler, who used to hold the top job there. Indeed, several U.S. Senators have already called to investigate the “widespread confusion” caused.So if you’re keeping track at home: the agency with a tripartite mission to protect consumers, foster capital formation and ensure fair markets has taken an L for trying and failing to keep a highly demanded product from launching, has been chewed out in court multiple times over unfair reasoning and crossed itself by not even following its own cybersecurity advice.Gensler came out swinging when he entered office, quickly dispelling any notion that the former MIT professor who taught about blockchain would be favorable to the industry. Early on, he called the whole shabang “decentralization theater.” It turns out, the only clown in this show is him."},

", "article body": "Smart contracts have emerged as an integral part of the Web3 ecosystem, but smart contract vulnerabilities have led to millions in lost user funds, highlighting the pressing need for smart contract security audits.In this guide, you will learn what smart contract audits are, what they typically entail, and the role they play in identifying vulnerabilities in Web3.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What Are Smart Contracts?A smart contract is a self-executing computer program stored on a blockchain that executes automatically when a set of predetermined conditions are met and verified.Smart contracts are used to create agreements that can execute automatically without any intermediaries or time loss. Beyond agreements, smart contracts may also be useful in automating workflows by triggering a specific action or set of actions when predefined conditions are achieved. As a result, smart contracts have become the bedrock of Web3, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps) running on public blockchains.What Is a Smart Contract Security Audit?A smart contract audit is the process of comprehensively analyzing the code used by developers to create a smart contract.The audit is carried out by security engineers to identify any potential security issues, risks, or inefficiencies in coding. This process guarantees the integrity and robustness of smart contracts by providing an avenue for identifying and resolving problems.Why Are Smart Contract Audits Important?Once deployed, changing the smart contract of a decentralized protocol isn’t that simple. So, if any vulnerability exists in the code, it can (and likely will) lead to a loss of funds. Even seemingly small bugs can lead to catastrophic losses for Web3 users after a project has launched. Due to such vulnerabilities and consequent hacks, billions of dollars have been lost in the DeFi industry in the last few years.Other reasons why smart contract auditing has become a crucial requirement for dApps include:Boosting user confidence: Allowing security experts to examine the security and performance of a smart contract instill confidence in users and investors. It assures all stakeholders that their investment is safer than on unaudited dApps.Preventing costly mistakes: Due to the immutability of the blockchain, it’s important to audit code in the development stage. If a severe flaw is detected after the launch, the project may have to redeploy a new smart contract which is both expensive and time-consuming.Expert review: A smart contract audit is typically done by an independent entity, separate from the code writers. Therefore, it offers an unbiased evaluation of the contract’s code, functionality, and security.How Do Smart Contract Audits Work?Smart contract audits implement a variety of tools and techniques to identify weak points, resolve vulnerabilities and make smart contracts more secure. While different engineers follow different approaches, the typical process involves the following:Gathering DocumentationDuring this stage, the project undergoing auditing submits the technical documentation to the auditors. These may include various elements such as the project’s codebase, architecture, whitepaper, and any other relevant material. This information gives auditors a deeper understanding of the project’s scope, objectives, and implementation.Automated TestingAutomated testing analyzes all the possible states of a smart contract and pinpoints problems that could compromise the security or functionality of the smart contract. At this point, engineers may also conduct integration, unit, and penetration tests to evaluate the individual functions that make up the smart contract.Manual Code ReviewIn this phase, a team of security engineers examines the code line by line to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and inefficient code that could undermine performance. While automated testing is adept at identifying bugs, it takes human experts to detect architectural or logical flaws within the smart contract. A manual review also provides opportunities to optimize gas consumption and rectify poor programming practices that are inefficient yet technically correct.Classification of Contract ErrorsThe classification of contract errors involves labeling all errors according to severity. These may include labels like critical, major, medium, minor, and informational errors.Initial ReportingAuditors will develop an initial report that lists the issues identified and how to resolve them. Depending on the auditor, some teams may fix any identified bugs themselves.Final Audit ReportingLastly, the auditor will prepare a final report that includes detailed results of all issues and whether they were resolved or not. This report is provided to the team behind a project and can be made available for the public to review for transparency purposes.The Bottom LineBy subjecting smart contracts to rigorous audits, dApp developers can strengthen their systems against potential exploits, hacks, and financial losses. In an ecosystem built on smart contracts, smart contract security audits are paramount to creating a secure user-experience."},

It provides an interface to buy, register, manage, and look up domain names.The two systems may fulfill the same need but differ in structure and architecture. Where DNS depends on centralized servers, BNS runs on peer-to-peer server systems that are secure and censorship-resistant.BNS names have three properties: universally unique, human-meaningful, and strongly owned.The Bitcoin Name System leverages the security and resilience of the Bitcoin network to facilitate a seamless user experience for Bitcoin Web3 users within the Stacks ecosystem, allowing users to send and receive STX as well as Stacked-based tokens and NFTs.How Do .BTC Domains Work?A .btc domain is a specific type of blockchain name registered and stored on the Bitcoin network as an NFT.The .btc domains are held on the BNS and registered through a smart contract on Stacks. The domains utilize Bitcoin’s security features and implement Clarity smart contracting language to create a decentralized name registry.Ownership of every .btc name is documented on the Bitcoin blockchain as a hash. Every domain and subdomain on BNS has Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that provide an eternal identifier for public keys and is compatible with other systems that use DIDs..BTC names are organized into a global name hierarchy in three layers; namespaces, BNS names, and BNS subdomains.Namespaces are similar to DNS top-level domains; they are names at the top of the hierarchy that anyone can create but not own.BNS names are recorded directly on the blockchain, and their creation depends on a namespace containing the BNS name already existing.BNS subdomain records are stored off-chain and are owned by separate private keys.You can register .btc names through a transaction with the BNS smart contract on Stacks. The smart contract ensures that BNS domains are synchronized and replicated to all other Stacks nodes worldwide.How to Buy Bitcoin DomainsBefore getting a .btc domain, you’ll need a wallet that supports .btc domains, such as Hiro Wallet or Xverse.You will also need STX in your wallet to purchase a Bitcoin domain on BNS. New domains cost 2 STX. These costs don’t include transaction fees. You can buy STX from an exchange and send it to your Stacks-compatible wallet.The steps to buying a Bitcoin domain are as follows;Search for your .btc nameGo to https://btc.us/ and write the name you want to register in the search bar on the landing page. A pop-up will tell you whether the name is available, the rates you’ll pay in STX, and how long you’ll have it (5 years for 2 STX).Create an AccountOnce you’ve confirmed the name is available, you must create a Bitcoin-connected Stacks account to start the purchase. Connect your Stacks-compatible wallet to the site to log in.Purchase Your Domain NameOnce you’re logged in, you will get a prompt to purchase the .btc domain you chose. Send in the 2 STX, and you’ll own the domain for five years. The transaction will incur a small gas fee. After the transaction is complete, the Bitcoin domain name will appear in your Stacks wallet.You can also buy a second-hand Bitcoin domain in secondary marketplaces. BNS names give people unique web3 identities and make it easier to complete transactions without making any errors."},

The wallet owner can be an individual or a group pooling resources to make significant investments.How Do Whales Influence the Market?Whales’ position as the biggest players in the Bitcoin market makes them highly influential. Their significant holdings allow them to significantly affect bitcoin’s immediate demand or supply on exchanges (or via OTC trading desks) whenever they trade. As a result, the market often responds with price movements.The price of bitcoin often rallies when a while decides to add to their bitcoin position due to the size of their trades. Conversely, if a Bitcoin whale opts to exit their position by selling a portion of their holdings, the price tends to respond with a decline.Moreover, a lot of whales’ wallets are publicly tracked, which results in the wider Bitcoin trading community responding to whale’s trading decisions (or expected trades), often resulting in a large price movement as many traders mirror the whale’s (expected) trade.Consequently, some whales prefer trading with others directly via OTC trading desks to limit their impact on the price. However, some whales trading on exchanges may take the opportunity to move the market in the direction they want by signaling to the market that they are a large buyer or seller.Three Ways to Spot a Bitcoin WhaleKnowing how to spot a Bitcoin whale can be a helpful addition to your Bitcoin trading arsenal, given its potential to impact the market with a simple buy or sell order.Let’s look at three ways you can spot a Bitcoin whale.Use Blockchain Explorers: Bitcoin’s public ledger allows you access to all transactions. Using a blockchain explorer such as blockchain.com, you can identify large amounts of bitcoin being moved.Analyze Trade Patterns: Whales tend to execute large trades, leading to sudden price dips or spikes. If you pay attention to trading patterns, the emergence of unusual patterns might signify a Bitcoin whale making a move.Social Media: Some bitcoin whales are active on social media, sharing their opinions on investment strategies and the bitcoin market. You can gain some insights into their potential trading activities and use information.Biggest Bitcoin Whales in the MarketAccording to this bitcoin whales chart, as of July 2023, there are 2,018 BTC wallets with balances of over 1,000 BTC. Some notable whales have held onto their bitcoin for the long term.Let’s look at five of the most notable, publicly known bitcoin whales.Satoshi Nakamoto: The identity of Bitcoin’s creator remains unknown, with no clear evidence of whether it is an individual or a group of people. Whoever they may be, they mined approximately 1 million BTC, and the wallet has remained inactive for years.Changpeng Zhao: With an estimated net worth of over $10 billion, the Binance co-founder is one of the top crypto billionaires. While the size of his BTC holdings is unknown, he’s indicated in the past that crypto forms 95% of his portfolio.The Winklevoss Twins: Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss started adding bitcoin to their portfolio in 2012. At some point, they owned approximately 1% of bitcoin’s circulating supply.Michael Saylor/MicroStrategy: Through MicroStrategy, his business analytics software company, Michael Saylor holds approximately 150,000 BTC. He’s one of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates, especially on his Twitter account, where he shares the benefits of Bitcoin.Tim Draper: The American venture capitalist famously bought 29,656 bitcoin from the U.S. Marshalls when Silk Road assets were auctioned. He is a prominent opponent of government overreach and advocates for decentralization. The size of his current BTC holdings is unknown, but he continues to be a vocal advocate.Spotting a bitcoin whale’s activities can help you make shrewd moves in the market. However, remember that even whales can make emotional decisions without rationality. Some may even seek to manipulate the market to benefit themselves. Ensure you go beyond tracking their activities and find their reasons before making decisions."},

Atomic swaps utilize self-executing smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency transactions across blockchains.Read on to learn how atomic swaps work, how they differ from cross-chain bridges, and what their benefits and drawbacks are.This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.What Are Atomic Swaps?An atomic swap protocol enables P2P transactions between parties wishing to exchange cryptocurrencies on different blockchain networks.Smart contracts eliminate the need for a third party, such as a centralized exchange, enabling decentralized, cross-chain crypto asset trading.The trustless and private nature of atomic swaps ensures that the parties involved remain confidential. However, the individual transactions involved in a cross-chain swap are still trackable on the public ledger of their respective blockchains.How Do Atomic Swaps Work?Atomic swaps enable cross-chain crypto asset swapping powered by cryptography and smart contracts. Let’s look at the process step by step.The smart contract creates a virtual vault for the crypto swap.The first party sends their cryptocurrency to a locked contract address within the vault.The second party confirms the deposit and sends their cryptocurrency to another locked contract address within the vault.The smart contract confirms that both parties have locked their respective amounts per the contract terms.Upon confirmation, the funds are released to the parties.If either party fails to execute their part as specified in the contract, the swap becomes invalid. If one party has sent their crypto, they receive a refund.How Do Atomic Swaps Differ From Bridges?Cross-chain swaps differ from cross-chain bridges even though they both offer blockchain interoperability.Blockchain bridges involve creating a wrapped token and then availing an equivalent amount on the target blockchain. You can then transfer or trade the wrapped token on the target blockchain or redeem it for the original assets on the source blockchain.Alternatively, atomic swaps enable P2P exchanges between two parties across two separate blockchains. There are no intermediaries involved. Additionally, swaps require the same hashing algorithm, while bridges don’t.Benefits of Atomic SwapsCross-chain swaps provide a suite of benefits to crypto traders.Lower fees: The absence of a third party generally reduces transaction costs.Cross-chain interoperability: Users can exchange assets from different blockchains without losing assets or private keys’ custody.No fiat currency involved: Crypto users can exchange assets without utilizing fiat currency as a baseline value.Faster speeds: Transactions are executed swiftly since the smart contract automatically executes once each party does its part.Enhanced security: The smart contracts involved offer higher security since users can regain their assets if the other party fails to perform as agreed.Drawbacks of Atomic SwapsIn their current form, cross-chain swaps present several challenges to users.Technical complexities: Atomic swaps require exchanging hashed cryptographic information. This closes the door to traders who lack the technical knowledge to understand such details and those with privacy concerns.Cryptographic hashing algorithm: Atomic swaps are only possible for cryptocurrencies belonging to networks with similar cryptographic hashing algorithms limiting the options for traders.Process complexity: In its current form, the atomic swapping process comprises more steps than trading on a centralized exchange.No crypto-fiat on-ramp: Cross-chain swaps don’t allow crypto to fiat exchanges. If you wish to liquidate to fiat, you must look for an alternative.One of the key aspects of decentralized trading is that users can maintain custody of their crypto assets. Conversely, centralized exchanges take custody of your assets and maintain access to your private keys. Consequently, the security of your crypto holdings relies on the exchange remaining solvent and invulnerable to any malicious attacks.Cross-chain swaps offer greater interoperability across various blockchain networks, ensuring truly decentralized trading. However, support for atomic swaps is only available on a few platforms, making access challenging. Additionally, you need some programming and cryptographic knowledge to understand the technical aspects of atomic swaps, which may be daunting to non-tech-savvy traders."},

Its creators are largely pseudonymous crypto developers who identify themselves online with pictures of cartoon bears – some smoking weed.That didn't stop the likes of Polychain Capital from investing in their vision for a new kind of blockchain. Under the hood, it's powered by a fresh take on the popular \"proof of stake\" model for securing blockchains called \"proof of liquidity,\" or PoL.Under PoL, ecosystem players help secure the Berachain network by providing liquidity to the trading infrastructure built on top of it. Infrastructure can mean many things: an automated market maker, a crypto game, a lending protocol – basically anything that needs a pool of user-supplied tokens to facilitate transactions via smart contracts.It's common in decentralized finance (DeFi) for these protocols to reward their liquidity providers (LPers) with a token. That's the plan for Berachain, too. Any protocol that's passed a Berachain governance vote will get BGT to give to their LPers.These BGT tokens are the governance tokens for Berachain, meaning its holders have power over the network. Notably, the tokens are also illiquid; you can't buy or sell them. The only way to get them is by earning them as a reward, Berachain cofounder Smokey the Bera told CoinDesk.\"Berachain is the first chain that's built to drive value to protocols,\" Smokey said in a Telegram message.The token's creators plan for it to have some economic value. Any BGT holder will be able to burn their assets in exchange for the equivalent amount of BERA tokens, which will be tradeable. Or, they can delegate their BGT to others in exchange for the Berachain stablecoin called HONEY, which Smokey said will be backed by USDC.This setup doesn't ensure Berachain will be entirely immune from economic whales. While \"you can't just buy the staking token,\" big bag holders could still buy lots of BERA, provide it as liquidity to trading protocols and receive outsize BGT, and the power they hold, Smokey said.Still, it's a much more active version of \"proof of stake\" than simply lending one's tokens to a validator. Under Berachain, the protocols themselves receive the liquidity of all the users seeking economic returns.The liquidity bootstrapping allows Berachain \"to accomplish more with less initial resources,\" Smokey said. That could be an important distinction given the number of new layer 1 blockchains rolling out and being announced.Berachain is positioning itself to appeal to the Ethereum crowd as well as Cosmos builders, Smokey said. It's already been in a private testnet for about a month and has more than 30 native teams, plus dozens more protocols from other ecosystems that are preparing to roll out versions of their project on Berachain.Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."},

She requested: \"If you quote any of the following, I ask that you use the statements in full and with context.\"Typically we don't have space to include such responses in their entirety, and we also try to distill information for the benefit or our readers.In this case, we're making an exception – because the matter goes right to the heart of the governance of the Bitcoin blockchain and the thrust of the main question raised in our original article: Who gets to decide which transactions are appropriate for the $900 billion blockchain, and which ones aren't?It's the kind of existential question that all the new investors in bitcoin ETFs might need to ground themselves in at some point.Below are Chow's verbatim responses to our questions regarding her decision to close the proposal, technically known as a \"pull request\" or PR:We were wondering if you had any comments on why you closed the pull request?Chow: As I said in the comment I left when closing the PR, it was obviously controversial and had no hope of reaching a conclusion acceptable to everyone. PRs that are unlikely to achieve (rough) consensus for merging should be closed.The PR was additionally locked since all it was doing was generating noise. Bitcoin Core uses GitHub for code collaboration and it is essentially the developers' place of work. When someone makes a bold claim on twitter that angers people, and then encourages them to leave comments on GitHub, they end up disrupting the developers. These comments often contain accusations of bad faith, poorly informed statements about the code, and demands for the developers to make major changes, which drag the developers into arguments in order to defend themselves and correct misconceptions. Since there are commenters in favor of both sides, there were also discussions amongst them that did not involve the developers at all, but still sent a notification to everyone. Overall, this has a negative effect on productivity, results in a more toxic environment, and drives away developers from their place of work.Was this a decision you took independently or did it follow discussions behind the scenes with other Bitcoin Core contributors/maintainers?Chow: The decision to close it at that time was made independently by myself. It was done after reading review comments from several long time contributors that NACK'd the PR and also suggested that it should be closed. These review comments provided technical criticisms that generally concluded that the PR in its current state was not a good idea and was potentially harmful.We were curious if you have received any backlash and/or comments behind the scenes following the decision to close that PR?Chow: Yes. As with any other controversial PR, there are two camps within the wider Bitcoin community – one for merging and one against. Any action taken with the PR will of course result in both camps expressing their feelings on that action. This is expected.Dashjr has asserted that the PR was “inappropriately” closed – curious if you might have a comment on that?Chow: Since I closed the original PR, I do not believe that it was inappropriately closed. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Edited by Marc Hochstein."},

The EBA, for instance, is charged with creating a single rulebook under MiCA for stablecoin issuers and will later elaborate on related policies supervisors must implement.During Thursday’s hearing, EBA policy officials broke down its proposed guidelines for issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ART), which MiCA defines as crypto that references the value of one or more official currencies or assets to maintain stability.The hearing covered EBA proposals for the first batch of guidelines on internal governance of stablecoin issuing companies, requirements for management, compliance, remuneration as well as disclosures for conflicts of interest.“We pay high attention to this batch and need also a very good understanding with you, so please seize this public hearing as an opportunity to dialogue with us so we start on the right footing,” Isabel Vaillant, EBA director of prudential regulation, said during the hearing. Another official said it was “really important\" to get input from various stakeholders.With several of its open consultations set to close later this month, the EBA is set to host similar hearings next week. Feedback from the consultations will be used to finalize its rulebook.Edited by Parikshit Mishra."},

A limit increase could improve network capacity and potentially reduce costs for users. ", "article body": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested raising the network's gas limit by 33% on Wednesday – a move that would raise the network's transaction capacity and could reduce fees for end-users, but could increase operational costs for validators.Users of the Ethereum blockchain pay gas fees to ensure that their transactions are added to the network, and the gas that one pays to execute a transaction roughly correlates to its computational complexity (e.g. a simple token swap will cost less gas than opening up a convoluted lending position).Ethereum's gas limit refers to the total amount of gas that can be squeezed into an individual Ethereum block – the bundles of transactions that get added to the Ethereum network at regular intervals. Increasing the gas limit would mean increasing the amount (and complexity) of transactions that can be added to a block.Buterin made the gas increase suggestion during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session featuring the Ethereum Foundation Research group.\"The gas limit has not been increased for nearly three years, which is the longest time ever in the protocol's history,\" Buterin wrote in response to a commenter who asked whether Ethereum could \"safely increase\" its gas limit. Buterin suggested increasing the gas limit to 40 million gas units – a 33% increase over today's 30 million limit.A ramp-up in Ethereum's gas limit wouldn't require a big update or \"hard fork\" of the network's core code. Instead, the validators that operate the network should be able to implement the change by adjusting certain parameters in their node software.Calls for increasing the gas limit started back in December when some of Ethereum's layer 2 (L2) networks were experiencing record usage. Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis Chain, wrote on X that for “Ethereum to become a settlement layer for L2s it needs to increase its block gas limit.”Following Buterin’s Reddit comments on Wednesday, more users on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, chimed in with words of support for the suggested increase. Jesse Pollak, the head of protocols at Coinbase and creator of the layer-2 blockchain Base, shared his support of the move and suggested the gas limit could even be increased even further, to 45 million.Others expressed more caution about the gas change, like Ethereum core developer Dankrad Feist, who suggested that calldata and blobs per block should be targeted in addition to the overall gas limit.As for what the limit increase accomplishes, \"it simply allows more activity on L1 - it will either reduce tx costs - or more likely IMO just increase capacity at similar cost -> more burn,” said Köppelmann."},

Will 2024 be the year of the adoption of AI in financial services?Lynda Koster from Growthential provides an overview of how AI can be leveraged as a strategic advantage for financial firms.Happy reading.– S.M.You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.Strategic Leadership in the Generative AI EraToday's rapidly changing global landscape offers challenges and opportunities for business leaders. They confront constant disruptions, and generative artificial intelligence is a significant driver of some of these changes. Every day new information and developments emerge, making it challenging for leaders to decide the best course of action.In this dynamic environment, adopting a passive stance could jeopardize progress. It is essential for leaders to understand both the immense potential and the associated risks of generative AI early on. Failure to do so may lead to missed opportunities and a loss of competitive ground to rivals who are more agile in testing and adopting emerging AI capabilities.One common question is whether generative AI's prominence is merely hype. While some may exaggerate the reality of where some of the capabilities are today, there's no denying its transformative power. Using insights from history and previous tech revolutions, leaders can better understand and navigate this AI phase.Historically, the initial skepticism around the internet's emergence turned into an acknowledgment of its massive impact. Similarly, the boom in marketing technology tools offers lessons on the pitfalls of hasty adoption without a strategy. The generative AI revolution, while mirroring past tech trends, is unique in its rapid development and potential impacts. This accelerated pace is due to existing infrastructures and prior technological advances, coupled with it being released to the masses.Recent reports highlight the growing adoption of AI. Thus, to harness its benefits and avoid its challenges, businesses should draw from past lessons and current knowledge.In the realm of financial advisory, AI has the potential to become an indispensable tool for financial advisors, a group whose work heavily relies on intellectual capabilities and knowledge-based decision-making. Generative AI, in particular, stands to augment financial advisors' capabilities, while increasing efficiencies, enabling sophisticated management and utilization of their intellectual property (IP) when leveraged within secure, non-public domains.Questions are being raised on how to continue to provide added and differentiated value when clients and competitors have access to the same emerging tools and access to a new level of intelligence offered by these platforms. Additionally, it is emphasized that this technology does not replicate the human elements of empathy, trust, emotion and personal connection, which are cornerstones of the client-advisor relationship.This is pushing financial advisors to move beyond focusing on specific tools or technologies. Instead, they are considering how AI integrates into their individual strategies or their firm's overarching goals, culture, client needs, cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance requirements.Acknowledging the benefits and challenges of AI, particularly in financial advising, highlights its wider impact on their independent or organizational strategy. This goes beyond adopting technology, encompassing scenario planning and change management. As individuals and companies embed AI into their workflows and operations, they need to adjust their strategies and mindsets for diverse future scenarios, preparing for the significant changes AI introduces to maintain resilience and agility in a dynamic business environment. The evolving nature of work demands reskilling and constant learning. This isn't just about implementing software but reshaping the organization's culture and mindset for an AI-powered world.As we navigate the complexities of the generative AI era, it is crucial for individuals and businesses to stay informed and proactive. The lessons of the past and the realities of the present offer a clear message: Success hinges on strategic planning and a willingness to embrace change. For those in the realm of financial advising and beyond, it is not just about adopting new technologies, but about integrating them in a way that aligns with your organization’s long-term vision and ethical standards. The road ahead is not without challenges, but by prioritizing continuous learning and adaptability, businesses can leverage AI to not just meet the demands of today, but thrive, setting standards for the future.- Lynda Koster, Cofounder & Managing Partner, GrowthentialAsk an Expert: Cutting Through the AI HypeQ: Is AI as disruptive as the hype suggests?Depends where you're looking. In a report on the future of generative AI, McKinsey & Company examined the potential for automating work across several industries, and found that knowledge work was most prone to disruption from generative AI. Workforce training, for example, is highly susceptible to automation, whereas agriculture and transportation less so. Creative industries, such as media and the arts, were also high on the list.Q: How should I think about using AI in my organization?Even in industries that are ripe for disruption from AI, like marketing, you're more likely to find usage of generative AI at small to midsize companies, since they tend to be more willing to experiment. Use of generative AI is often a bottom-up phenomenon, with individuals in an organization finding efficiencies by applying the tools to their specific work, usually with a lot of trial and error, and sometimes without even telling their employer. For an organization to unlock generative AI's potential at scale, it'll need to invest time and expertise to research the models available, and then build tools that abstract the tedious work of finding the right prompts (a.k.a. prompt engineering) so the AI's output is reasonably consistent.Q: What are the risks in using generative AI?While generative AI can create text, images and video nearly instantaneously, there are some broad concerns about the content it creates:Legal: The large language models (LLMs) that power generative AI services use massive amounts of training data, harvested from the open web. While \"crawling\" internet content is standard practice for search engines, AI services create wholly new content based on that information, typically without linking or even crediting it. That may amount a copyright violation — the basis for The New York Times' recent lawsuit against OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.Safety: It's possible to use LLMs, intentionally or unintentionally, in ways that create content that misleads or offends, and may even be criminal in nature (think deepfakes). AI companies usually build guardrails into their models that reduce the likelihood of that happening, but since how LLMs craft answers isn't fully understood, it's impossible to eliminate it completely. In addition, overcorrecting for \"unsafe\" outputs can render the model less useful overall.Quality: AI tools sometimes hallucinate — essentially make up facts and state them with supreme confidence — which has led to several embarrassing incidents where generative content was published or used without proper vetting. These cases emphasize the need for human oversight of any AI-driven process (a.k.a. \"Human in the loop\"). But even when the AI gets things right, the writing can often feel basic and soulless. The desire to improve upon \"out of the box\" outputs of LLMs is creating demand for skills in fine-tuning and prompt engineering.— Pete Pachal, Founder, The Media CopilotKeep ReadingThe majority of advisors are bullish about AI according to Arizent’s latest research.OpenAI called the \"regurgitation” of NY Times content a “rare bug” in a recently published statement released in response to the NY Times lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft.The importance of good data in, good data out; the SEC announced their X (formerly Twitter) account was compromised after a tweet went out Tuesday Jan 9 stating the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved.

Whether that price trend will continue in the short term depends on \"the trajectory of other monetary policy, and whether we will not see more scandals,\" from the crypto space, Gusdorf said.Bitcoin's price experienced some volatility on Thursday, climbing as high as nearly $49,000 but falling to $46,000 within the space of about 90 minutes. However, the asset's price has more than doubled over the past year, according to CoinGecko.\"In the medium to long term, we see it as a positive development that will increase the price discovery and the stability of bitcoin. And it will probably increase the allocation of some institutional investors to this asset class,\" Ventricelli said.Moody’s doesn’t rate bitcoin and can’t really comment on whether it’s a significant credit risk, but investing through traditional players like BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) were among the ETFs that started trading today, according to Gusdorf. But buyers can \"remove some of the risks that could be associated with a middleman that could have been probably less regulated before the SEC decision.\"He warned, however, that bitcoin remains a very volatile investment and that investors should keep this risk in mind when allocating funds from their portfolios.Crypto x TradFiETFs are also not the only way crypto is colliding with the world of traditional finance (TradFi). Gusdorf and Ventricelli said their team has been closely watching developments in the field of tokenization, where blockchain and distributed ledger technologies that power crypto are used for digitizing real assets be they bonds, funds or commodities.Central banks and big TradFi players have been experimenting with tokenization, with a few already offering tokenized green bonds and other funds.According to Marat Faritov, assistant vice president of the DFDA unit at Moody’s, the approval of bitcoin ETFs is also positive for other players in the crypto industry, from custody solutions providers to tokenizers.\"For example, now banks will start using those services to enable the solutions so probably will be generating more revenue for all these companies around the crypto space,\" Faritov said.According to Gusdorf, although crypto is \"increasingly less mentioned\" at conferences on tokenization, there has been a convergence between the TradFi and crypto spaces. Earlier this month, Gusdorf’s team rated a tokenized fund to be issued on the Ethereum and Stellar blockchains.\"So we are seeing a number of bridges being built between the crypto worlds and the TradFi world here,\" Gusdorf said.Edited by Nikhilesh De."},

While some view crypto's linking up with traditional finance as a positive and inevitable part of going mainstream, others worry it spells bad news for the promise of decentralization.It's official. The U.S. securities watchdog on Wednesday made history by begrudgingly approving a batch of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETF), energizing markets that were for months trembling with anticipation.These hard-won approvals are largely viewed as a leg-up for an industry hoping to rebuild its reputation after 2022's spectacular market collapse fueled by Sam Bankman-Fried and others. But for long-time crypto advocates, considerations may go beyond market recovery.Some fear that fraternizing with crypto's original enemy – traditional finance (TradFi), Big Banks and Wall Street, which early fans of the Bitcoin blockchain had in their sights – threatens to break its original promise of decentralizing financial services. Others contend that bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency, was intended for the masses, and that some form of alignment with TradFi was unavoidable – with benefits to both parties.\"It was always an inevitable part of the process of going mainstream,\" Jameson Lopp, software engineer and bitcoin advocate, said during an interview, speaking about crypto and TradFi colliding through the creation of bitcoin ETFs. \"Wall Street wants a cut of the action.\"However, these bitcoin ETFs will \"accelerate the flywheel of adoption\" and make the asset class \"less of a scary concept\" to mainstream audiences, he added.Read more: On Bitcoin White Paper's 15th Anniversary, Wall Street Threatens to Swallow Its One-Time ChallengerSpot ETFs allow investors to take advantage of the popular cryptocurrency's volatile price movement sans the hassle of having to learn about strange-sounding concepts like self-custody, blockchain and private keys.Erik Voorhees, one of crypto's earliest entrepreneurs, said on social media platform X that the \"most important result\" of bitcoin ETFs would be dissuading governments from treating the crypto harshly.\"When 50 million boomers own bitcoin passively, the political and economic damage from a ban will be significantly less palatable. It's no longer just an asset for shadowy super coders,\" Voorhees said. \"And it's absolutely a Trojan Horse about to be pulled through gates of Troy.\"Threat of corruptionIf Satoshi Nakamoto releasing the Bitcoin white paper 15 years ago was an almighty act of rebellion against TradFi – like the Greek god Zeus fighting his titan father Cronus to avoid being eaten up like his siblings – then bitcoin was supposed to be the people's weapon against the unchecked power of big banks, whose irresponsibility and greed brought the global economy to its knees in 2008.It's unsurprising, then, that to some purists on both sides, the ETF approvals not only represent the convergence of two worlds designed to be rivals, but the potential corruption of both.\"The approval of bitcoin ETFs will inevitably turn out to be a very bad thing for Bitcoin decentralization,\" said Proof of Decentralization podcast host Chris Blec on X.While ETFs will see new institutional and retail money flowing into crypto, Nicky Gomez, senior partner at XReg Consulting, warns they will also influence more centralization moving bitcoin \"further away from its true value and potential.\"\"Ultimately, this will spur a larger divide with the crypto purists,\" Gomez said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.On the TradFi side, economic security nonprofit Better Markets criticized the SEC approvals on X, saying bitcoin and crypto \"remain the preferred product of speculators, gamblers, predators and criminals.\"SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw called the development \"unsound and ahistoric\" in a Wednesday statement.Though he doesn't think bitcoin ETFs are good or bad for crypto, Lopp hopes huge fund inflows and mainstream interest won't change the protocols of networks like Bitcoin.\"Hopefully, the ETF issuers won't care much about the properties of the protocol because they won't actually be interacting with it – their custodians will handle all the heavy lifting,\" Lopp said.As for whether ETFs will work against the idea of self-custody championed by crypto, Lopp said keeping control of one's assets was always an optional thing.\"If someone prefers the convenience of an ETF over holding the actual asset, that's their choice. One could make similar arguments with regard to any commodity that is traded via ETFs. Few folks want to take custody of barrels of oil, for example,\" he said.A case for the inevitableLike Lopp, CoinDesk columnist and equity researcher J.P. Koning makes a case that crypto mingling with TradFi was inevitable.\"Since bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, adoption has always relied on close integration with traditional finance, so a bitcoin ETF is nothing new, really; it represents just one more upgrade of the very old linkage between the two,\" Koning said.A rather straightforward view would be that, at the end of the day, it all comes down to price.\"I don't see bitcoin ETFs as clashing with what original proponents of crypto hoped for, because from the very start even the most idealistic strains of bitcoinism were always twinned with the raw desire to make money,\" Koning said. \"For the number to go up, more funds must be drawn in, which requires not only relying on the linkages already forged to traditional finance, like the integration with the card networks, but new forms of interconnection.\"\"After the ETF has begun to trade, the bitcoin community will go on to pushing for the next big bond to TradFi, because that's what will drive the price even higher,\" he said.Edited by Nick Baker."},

Here's a look at the sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.", "article body": "Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and is now the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Just like the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), ether can be used to send payments directly to another person without the need for an intermediary.The long-term vision for Ethereum is to power more than just financial transactions. Software developers can build applications on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks to develop and exchange content. ETH is unique in its ability to fill the role of a capital asset, consumable/transformable asset, and as a store of value.The innovative qualities of Ethereum have led to an explosion of new digital assets in the Smart Contract Platform (SCP) sector. This blog post takes a brief look at the Smart Contract Platform sector, its significance as a digital asset sector and how CoinDesk Indices is setting standards that define this sector.The SCP sectorSmart contracts are computerized blockchain protocols that execute terms of a contract. Smart contracts represent computer codes ensuring that when both parties meet the terms of the contract they will execute automatically, allowing for trustless, peer-to-peer transactions. SCP assets are designed for the building of decentralized applications, layer 2 scaling systems, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and other custom protocols.Every platform has a unique open-source user and miner incentive structure that utilizes the Byzantine Fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. Every platform also utilizes a native token for the payment towards building on the platform, providing liquidity and allowing interoperability between the native token and the newly created tokens built on the platform.SCP sector is part of DACS: What does that mean?In December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry defined by DACS. Then, at least one industry is assigned to an industry group. Finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.The SCP sector is the second-largest sector in DACS, with 88 assets representing over 35% of the digital asset market worth approximately $750 billion in market capitalization as of March 31, 2022. In addition to the SCP sector, DACS offers five other sectors: Currency, Computing, Culture & Entertainment, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and Digitization. The six sectors in DACS represent 22 industry groups and 35 industries.Assigning industries to the SCP sectorTo be assigned to an industry in the SCP sector, the digital asset must be transparent, self-executing and trustless. Smart contract platforms tend to have their own blockchains and consensus mechanisms, but it is disputable how to classify tokens with smart contract capabilities, depending on whether they are used for specific applications or not intended to build dapps (decentralized applications). There are also debates on whether smart contracts need to be decentralized and whether a permissioned blockchain can be classified as smart contract platform.There are two single-industry groups: Multi-Chain/Parachain and Single Chain.The Multi-Chain/Parachain industry includes smart contract platform assets that enable multiple parallel blockchains and cross-chain interoperability. The platform can be structured with a relay chain that allows slots for external parallel chains, or parachains.The Single Chain industry includes layer 1, or base, blockchain in which all transactions are recorded on the primary distributed ledger. The Single chain allows for layer 2, or companion, scaling systems that remain tied to the primary blockchain for transactional competency.SCP sector offers investors flexibilityAt present, CoinDesk Indices offers two indices based on the SCP sector. The flagship index is the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Index (SCPX) that constitutes a diversified basket of smart contract platform assets with ETH making up 73% of its portfolio from its market cap weighting. However, many investors who already hold ETH do not look for that much exposure to it.Therefore, the CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Select Ex ETH Index (SCPXX), which is just like SPCX but without ETH, offers flexibility to investors to get exposure to assets in the smart contract platform to complement their existing positions in ETH. Alternatively, SCPXX can be used simply to get exposure to the smaller assets inside the SCP sector. The two, taken together, can be analyzed for insights on performance between ETH and the rest of the sector.The digital assets in the SCP sector indices are determined by eligibility criteria for investability and liquidity that have the following requirements:· Ranked in the top 200 of the DACS universe· Listed on eligible exchanges for at least 30 days· Supported by eligible custodians· Market cap is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assets· Median daily trading volume over the past 30 days is higher than the median of the top 20 eligible assetsShaping the digital asset economyThe SCP sector tends to foster a rich environment for innovation that attracts a high level of development and resources. These platforms leverage network effects, decentralized consensus mechanisms and compatibility with various programming languages that enable creative and innovative developers to build protocols for a wide range of purposes such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.The SCP sector serves as a foundation for the digital economy as the dapps built on these platforms attract numerous users, empowering individuals to take greater ownership over their finances and transactions and creating a burgeoning economy with a wide range of opportunities. They also facilitate a positive reinforcement cycle through the network effect.The SCPX and SCPXX indices offer investors greater transparency into the sector, offering essential intelligence needed to allow them to express their views by making decisions and executing more efficiently.To find out more about DACS and its indices, contact us at info@coindesk-indices.com.Relevant indicesSmart Contract Platform Index (SCPX)Smart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX)Index-linked productsSmart Contract Platform ex-ETH Index (SCPXX) underlies the Grayscale® Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum FundDisclaimer:CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

CoinDesk Indices, the publisher of the ETI, sat down with Index Coop’s Head of Product, Allan Gulley, to talk about the DAO’s product strategy and cdETI.The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.The Index Coop was one of the first organizations to launch on-chain indices, notably with DPI and MVI. Can you share more about what you’re working on now?Yes, that’s right. We were early to the on-chain structured product market. Our early products, like DPI and MVI, were thematic baskets of tokens built on Set Protocol, and “diversification” was the simple strategy that we effectively tokenized. We later ventured into more sophisticated structured products, like ETH2x-FLI, that allowed us to tokenize more complex strategies.Our on-chain indices did well during the bull market, but like everyone else we've been building through the bear market so that we can be well positioned as the overall environment improves, as it is now. We’re branching out and experimenting with different automated strategies and on-chain asset classes. We’ll still create index-style products, but the market is signaling that people are interested in earning yield, using leverage, and executing more complex strategies, so we’re responding to those needs as well.As you know, we launched the Index Coop CoinDesk ETH Trend Index (cdETI). The idea for this product is that it will reduce the volatility from holding ETH by dynamically allocating between WETH and USDC based on CoinDesk Indices’ Ether Trend Indicator, which uses current and historical data to measure momentum in the ETH price.You mentioned that cdETI aims to reduce some of the volatility associated with holding ETH. How does that work?A truism in the financial world is that most people are bad at timing the market. With cdETI, we’re tokenizing our implementation of the CoinDesk Indices Ether Trend Indicator so that users can benefit from positive ETH price action while dampening volatility to the downside. This is intended to mitigate the need for users to constantly monitor the market or engage in active trading.To state it simply, the trend indicator works by comparing recent prices to historical prices using a series of moving averages. When the indicator signals strongly that the direction or strength of ETH price is stalling or falling, the token rebalances from WETH to USDC. When the indicator signals strong positive price momentum, the token reallocates to WETH. ETI levels between these strong indications maintain a 50/50 allocation between WETH and USDC.By automatically rebalancing between WETH and USDC, cdETI has the potential to capture bullish price movements for token holders while preserving capital during bearish scenarios. As a result, passive holders may maintain their WETH position while having some protection to the downside due to the data-driven methodology under the hood.Looking ahead, where do you see the on-chain structured product market going in the next year?One thing I expect to see is the blending of on-chain technology with Web2-style interfaces, platforms and custody solutions. While there are some DeFi purists out there who don't want on-chain assets anywhere near Web2 platforms, we think there can be productive partnerships between on-chain products and off-chain distributors.We’ve pursued a number of partnerships with platforms and custodians like Matrixport, BitGo and Copper to give our users as many ways as possible to access our products. It’s imperative that users always have the option to self-custody on-chain products, but for the broader base of users who have different preferences, we want to ensure our products are available to them where they are the most comfortable and convenient.You sound optimistic about the future of on-chain products, but on-chain products, as of yet, have not captured significant market share. Why do you think that is?It’s true, the on-chain structured product market is small right now. When we published our industry report in June, the on-chain structured product market made up 0.21% of the overall crypto market with a combined Total Value Locked (TVL) of $2.5bn. At the same time, there was $48.3bn of assets in the DeFi market and $1.19tn in assets in the crypto market.Why the on-chain structured product market is so small is something we looked at in our white paper. We also recently published an article where we asked six experts in our space this exact question. Several of these experts cited the lack of access to these products, especially in the U.S. where ambiguous and antagonistic regulatory efforts are shutting down many on-chain providers. Many structured products are also not as cost-effective as they should be, especially since most of them are on Ethereum mainnet where transaction costs can be prohibitive for smaller users who may want to dollar cost average in.As the digital asset market continues to mature, we expect the on-chain structured product sector to grow and gain market share relative to the rest of DeFi. Things have evolved rapidly in the last few years, and we’re optimistic that the next several years will bring regulatory clarity and improved infrastructure for building these products.What are the advantages to having these product on-chain?That’s a great question. At the Index Coop we believe that on-chain structured products ultimately create the best user experience. First and foremost, on-chain products are transparent. Users can independently verify the holdings, strategies, and smart contracts supporting our products in real-time. Our products can also be permissionlessly issued with or redeemed for their underlying assets at any time, allowing arbitrageurs to keep their price in line with their net asset value (NAV) and avoiding persistent premiums or discounts commonly observed with off-chain structured products.We also see security as a selling point for these products. Though there have been a number of high profile hacks in other areas of DeFi, we ultimately expect on-chain products to be extremely secure as the infrastructure is stress tested and audits are performed on a routine basis.On-chain products also have the potential to be globally accessible. Obviously there are limitations in certain jurisdictions due to regulatory issues, but like many in the DeFi space, we’re excited by the possibility of offering globally-available products that are accessible 24/7 to anyone with an internet connection.Disclosure:This content was produced by CoinDesk Indices, Inc.

", "article body": "Max Good, senior index research analyst at CoinDesk Indices, contributed writing for this report.Acknowledgement:We thank our former intern, Zad Mahana, for his expertise and assistance in all aspects of our work on Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) and for his help in writing this paper.IntroductionIn December 2021, CoinDesk Indices launched its Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS) to set the standard for defining the industries of digital assets. Every one of the top 500 digital assets by market capitalization is assigned to an industry, defined by DACS, then at least one industry is assigned to an industry group, and finally, at least one industry group is assigned to a sector.Currently, there are six sectors defined by DACS including Currency, Computing, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), Digitization, Culture & Entertainment, and Smart Contract Platform. The Computing sector is the fifth-largest sector in DACS with 68 assets representing 1.7% of the digital asset market worth approximately $29.9 billion in market capitalization as of April 30,2022.Exhibit 1: CoinDesk Indices DACS(CoinDesk Indices, May 13, 2022. Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.)Defining the Computing sectorThe CoinDesk DACS Computing sector contains protocols that aim to build and support the infrastructure of Web3 and distributed computing. The decentralization of Web2 services like cloud computing, storage, networking and databases has the ability to increase security and privacy measures by removing the centralized points of failure that exist in Web2 providers. In addition, these systems return ownership of data and information to the network participants in a way that users can earn revenue by contributing to their operation.The DACS Glossary defines the Computing sector as follows:The Computing sector consists of projects that aim to decentralize the sharing, storing, and transmission of data by removing intermediaries and ensuring privacy for all users. All projects that aim to gather, transmit, store and share data and web services in a decentralized manner play a key role in building the infrastructure of Web3. This includes on-chain and off-chain data transmission, social data platforms, peer-to-peer secure data transactions, open networks, free market private computation, and decentralized file storage and file sharing.Industry groups inside the Computing sectorThe industry groups in the Computing sector depend on the services the protocol offers. Each project serves a different function in decentralized computing and has varying tokenomics and incentive structures. The industries in the Computing sector include Shared Storage, Oracle, IoT, Private Computing and Shared Network. The CoinDesk DACS Glossary definitions for each of the above industries is as follows:Shared Storage refers to the decentralization of storage servers that are traditionally owned and operated by a central organization. Shared storage protocols such as Filecoin (FIL) 1 decentralizes the storage responsibilities across an open-source network of miners with a system of economic incentives. This allows for pseudonymous, private file sharing on a decentralized network. The centralization of cloud data storage offers high risks that expose the cloud network to potential hacks. Malicious actors have the potential to access sensitive information of millions of users, through a singular data breach due to the inherent centralization. Shared storage platforms increase security of data storage by running on a blockchain network that allows for privacy and pseudonymity of data transmitters.Oracle refers to any project with the primary ability to gather, organize and transmit either on-chain to on-chain data or off-chain to on-chain data in real time. Blockchain oracles typically operate with a native token to cover transaction costs and governance rights. Oracles can enable real time off-chain data to be used in decentralized applications. The largest asset in the Computing sector, Chainlink (LINK) 2, is widely used by many DeFi applications as a source of off-chain market data.IoT includes protocols that contribute to the development of the Internet of Things and Web3 that combine blockchain with real world, off-chain connections. IoT platforms such as Helium (HNT) 3 allow for application interoperability between IoT networks and blockchains. They allow interconnectivity on a trustless network with no reliance on any central entity or centralized database of user info that can be subject to manipulation. IoT can allow the execution of smart contracts using oracles and real-world data.Private Computing refers to the free market buying and selling of cloud computing power, surplus bandwidth, security as a service, and other computational services for one-off instances on demand. Private computing markets are decentralized, global, and pseudonymous with no barriers to entry. In Private Computing, providers can list their own individual computation or security capabilities which users can purchase based on the listed market prices set by the provider.Shared Network refers to an open network of distributed cloud computing that allows participants (miners) to offer energy and computation resources at a variable cost to pseudonymous buyers. A Shared Network also includes open networks that provide miners with a low cost, decentralized alternative to the existing web service providers. The decentralized upholding of the network and its growth aligns with Metcalfe’s law of networks and relinquishes the need for large, centralized cloud service providers.Within the Computing sector, Shared Storage Oracle and IoT are the three largest industry groups, representing 30.1%, 27.4%, and 27.2% of the sector market cap, respectively. Private Computing and Shared Network are smaller, representing 7.9% and 7.6% of the sector market cap, respectively.Exhibit 2: Computing Sector Breakdown by Industry Group(CoinDesk Indices, May 13, 2022.

Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.)Industries inside the Computing sectorWithin the Computing sector, each industry group currently consists of a single industry to which a digital asset is assigned. Therefore, the industry composition of the sector is the same as the industry group composition. However, as the sector grows, it is possible for additional industries to emerge.Major assets inside the Computing sectorThere are 68 digital assets inside the Computing sector, with top assets Chainlink (LINK) 2, representing 17.2% of the Computing Sector, and the top 10 assets representing 63.4% of the total market cap. There are 19 assets in the Shared Storage Industry Group, totaling around $9 billion in market cap, with Filecoin (FIL) 1 being the largest. In the Oracle industry group, there are 11 assets totaling around $8 billion in market cap, with Chainlink (LINK) 2 being the largest. There are currently 11 assets in the IoT industry group, totaling $8 billion in market cap, with Internet Computer (ICP) being the largest. There are 12 assets in Private Computing Industry Group with $2 billion market cap and Threshold (T) as its largest token. Finally, there are 15 assets in the Shared Network Industry group, with $2 billion market cap and Ankr (ANKR) as its largest token.Exhibit 4: Top 10 Assets Inside the DACS Computing Sector(CoinDesk Indices, May 13, 2022. Market capitalization data is based on 4/30/2022.)ConclusionThe Computing Sector includes assets that serve as platforms to decentralize the traditional web services; web services that have been prominent throughout Web 2.0. While many assets in this sector are still in the early adoption stage, their technology has strong foundations with decentralization as a key principle. By creating web services that are decentralized, more users can partake in and benefit from the application whilst giving providers economic incentives to sustain network growth. Decentralized distributed computing, storage and other services hold the potential to disrupt today’s web service providers and address the security issues associated with centralized databases as a central point of attack for malicious actors.Read more: How to Add Value to Real-World Documents With AuthenticationReferences1. Filecoin (FIL): Filecoin is a distributed file storage protocols built on Ethereum. It enables secure and private transaction of encrypted files on an immutable and censorship resistant blockchain. Transaction costs are paid to both Ethereum miners and the Filecoin miners. This creates an ecosystem in which miners can benefit from supporting the network and running the protocol, and users can benefit from the increased security and privacy achieved by distributed computing.2. Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized, open-source oracle service built on Ethereum. Chainlink oracles have the ability to connect both on-chain to on-chain data as well as on-chain to off-chain data. It allows smart contracts to access off-chain data feeds securely.3. Helium (HNT): Helium is a blockchain based network for IoT devices. It allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across the network nodes operated by users who mine and earn rewards in Helium’s native token HNT.

CoinDesk Indices, which provides the fund’s benchmark, sat down with Jason Hall, CEO of MCM, to talk about Ethereum staking and investor adoption.The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.Why is ETH staking considered to be a more stable digital asset investment?In the long term, we believe ETH Network usage will be the ultimate determining factor of returns. By nearly any metric, the majority of blockchain activity occurs within Ethereum’s ecosystem, making Ether the most utilized token. We think this positions ETH to be the greatest beneficiary of future blockchain technology adoption. Digital assets can be volatile, however, when volatility coincides with high network activity, Ethereum’s well-established baseline adoption rate promotes asset stability and can exhibit a flight-to-safety quality, especially relative to other crypto assets. There are also mechanical benefits to how the Ethereum blockchain functions. The token supply is adjusted based on network activity which can reduce supply when transaction volume is high. The ETH staking reward rate also increases in periods of high activity, leading to an increased total return, if your ETH is staked. While it’s difficult to net these forces out, together we believe they can amount to increased stability for asset owners.What will investors miss out on by not having total return on ETH staking rewards in their portfolio?Staking ETH allows investors to access the power of compounding rewards. Staked ETH rewards are paid in-kind which increases an investor’s ETH position, creating a flywheel effect. People tend to over focus on their long-term price appreciation goals and lose sight of the power of accumulating a larger holding through staking. In sideways markets, staking rewards improve your total return and, in down markets, staking acts almost like a dollar cost averaging strategy. Interestingly, we’ve seen instances where the staking reward rate increases during periods of volatility, further benefiting the asset. So purely from a rate perspective, you have a barbell effect where you can do well in up and down markets, all else equal.How does MCM help investors gain access to ETH staking rewards?MCM has expanded the accessibility of staked ETH by enabling investors to gain exposure to the asset through fiat currency, stablecoins, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the investment itself is a private fund, which means the shares can be held on a traditional balance sheet if the investor isn’t crypto native, or tokenized if they are. Operationally, we focus heavily on mitigating externalities that investors face in crypto such as: regulatory, reputation and operational risks in addition to compliance and balance sheet issues. We also seek to provide accountability through our benchmark, the CoinDesk Ether Total Return Index (ETXTR).How did MCM come to be an established fund manager in the digital asset space?At MCM we are dedicated to elevated partnerships and committed to precision and transparency. Our team has worked at the highest levels of the traditional finance industry and understands the requirements of sophisticated investors. Throughout our processes you’ll find multiple levels of redundancy. The nascent nature of the asset class, the steep learning curve, and the hostile regulatory environment make crypto a challenging place for institutional investors, yet interest in the space is growing rapidly. We planted our flag in the digital asset realm by employing exceptional risk management that focuses on the main concerns of investors.How is MCM navigating the regulatory environment around digital assets?Our mission is to introduce people to the generational wealth building opportunity that we believe is available through blockchain technology. Clear, thoughtful regulatory frameworks are required to create an enduring partnership with investors. At the moment, crypto/digital assets lack a coherent framework from regulatory bodies. Most of the ambiguity lies in how crypto is classified within securities laws, how the SEC classifies certain service providers, and what regulatory body should govern crypto. We have a strong view on regulation but we don’t assume we’re right, and don’t assume we can predict how regulation will evolve. Rather, we operate within the existing parameters and focus on the risks we can manage. We hope regulations evolve in a way that supports innovation and adoption but our job is to reduce risk, not create it by taking interpretive liberties.Where would someone go to receive additional information?Our approach to navigating the intricacies of digital asset investment is multifaceted and tailored to individual investor objectives. Whether aiming for blockchain exposure, expressing a view on crypto, accumulating assets for future on-chain business, or managing treasury reserves, we adopt a consultative strategy. We are happy to connect with those pursuing these objectives, providing tailored guidance and support to achieve their goals.
